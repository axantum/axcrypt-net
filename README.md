AxCrypt 2.1.x - Portable Open Source Encryption in C# for .NET/Mono.

### AxCrypt 2.1.x ###

Although the software is in release status, internal API:s may break at any moment. Use with care.

### How To Build? ###

For Windows, download the source code and open in Visual Studio. There
are no external dependencies that are not resolved with Nuget.

Unit tests require a NUnit-compatible unit test runner.

### How to Contribute ###

Talk to me. Due to the nature of the application, pull requests are audited very carefully.
Before requesting a pull it's best if we discuss things.

Minimum requirements is that FxCop/Static Code Analysis passes without warnings, as well as
compilation. There should be tests covering every line of code in Axantum.AxCrypt.Core.
