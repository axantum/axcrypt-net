About Axantum.AxCrypt.MonoTouch

This assembly is the MonoTouch-specific implementation of the various platform-specific interfaces
defined and used by Axantum.AxCrypt.Core.

Some of the code is identical with the generic Mono implementation, and is thus just linked to
in the project.

Some of the code is specific for MonoTouch and thus have a custom implementation here.

The main application should configure itself for MonoTouch by a line of code similar to:

            OS.Current = new Axantum.AxCrypt.MonoTouch.RuntimeEnvironment();

NOTE: You must build Axantum.AxCrypt.Core.dll separately for 'Debug' and 'Release' configuration as needed.
      This is built by the AxCrypt.NET solution, which can be loaded simultaneously into MonoDevelop for
      a reasonably convenient workspace environment.
