About Axantum.AxCrypt.exe

This is the reference code GUI for AxCrypt. It is intended to be portable between pure
Mono desktop platforms such as Linux and Windows. Mac OS X appears to be tougher.

In general a platform-specific GUI should be designed in each case, being as native as
possible. This GUI may become purely a reference GUI if/when specialized Linux and
Windows GUI'n are built.

A GUI implementation should only need Axantum.AxCrypt.Core.dll and BouncyCastle.Crypto.dll
as binary dependencies.

Comments and findings on Mono compatiblity, rationales etc.

- .NET 3.5 is used because for example MonoTouch does not support 4.0
- The 'resources' folder is all lower case because the designer forces lower case
  and this blows up on case-sensitive file systems.
- The build system is extend via 'Axantum.targets' which includes functionality
  for versioning the assemblies, signing them etc. The intention is for this to be
  ignored when not building at Axantum or when building in MonoDevelop etc. It should
  build in Visual Studio 2010 (Express) and MonoDevelop out of the box with no changes.
- Non-7-bit characters should be avoided in file names due to file system differences
  causing build problems.
