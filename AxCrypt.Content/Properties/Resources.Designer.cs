It is essentially the practice of encrypting certain data or information so that it can be kept secret from third parties. By converting your private information into a secret code that hides the information&apos;s true meaning, you make it almost impossible for an intruder to decrypt it into plaintext. When an encrypted message is intercepted by an unauthorized entity, the inflator has to guess the variables that [rest of string was truncated]&quot;;.
