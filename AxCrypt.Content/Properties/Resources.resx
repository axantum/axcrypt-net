    Microsoft ResX Schema 
    
    Version 2.0
    
    The primary goals of this format is to allow a simple XML format 
    that is mostly human readable. The generation and parsing of the 
    various data types are done through the TypeConverter classes 
    associated with the data types.
    
    Example:
    
    ... ado.net/XML headers & schema ...
    <resheader name="resmimetype">text/microsoft-resx</resheader>
    <resheader name="version">2.0</resheader>
    <resheader name="reader">System.Resources.ResXResourceReader, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <resheader name="writer">System.Resources.ResXResourceWriter, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <data name="Name1"><value>this is my long string</value><comment>this is a comment</comment></data>
    <data name="Color1" type="System.Drawing.Color, System.Drawing">Blue</data>
    <data name="Bitmap1" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded serialized .NET Framework object]</value>
    </data>
    <data name="Icon1" type="System.Drawing.Icon, System.Drawing" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded string representing a byte array form of the .NET Framework object]</value>
        <comment>This is a comment</comment>
    </data>
                
    There are any number of "resheader" rows that contain simple 
    name/value pairs.
    
    Each data row contains a name, and value. The row also contains a 
    type or mimetype. Type corresponds to a .NET class that support 
    text/value conversion through the TypeConverter architecture. 
    Classes that don't support this are serialized and stored with the 
    mimetype set.
    
    The mimetype is used for serialized objects, and tells the 
    ResXResourceReader how to depersist the object. This is currently not 
    extensible. For a given mimetype the value must be set accordingly:
    
    Note - application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64 is the format 
    that the ResXResourceWriter will generate, however the reader can 
    read any of the formats listed below.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.soap.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Soap.SoapFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized into a byte array 
            : using a System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    <value>The history of AxCrypt started in 2001 when initial author Svante needed to share confidential data over the Internet and failed to find existing data security solutions for Internet services that were both simple and easy to use for everyone.

  <data name="AboutAxcryptHistoryText2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>In 2014, after 13 years on the market, AxCrypt had grown to be one of the world’s most popular encryption applications with over 20 million downloads worldwide.

    <value>When selecting an encryption software, you must look into its algorithms to determine how your data will be secured or protected. For starters, an encryption algorithm transforms plain text into the encrypted text to prevent hackers from quickly accessing them.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_5KFESSAO_H1_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>However, since not all codes or algorithms are equal, some perform faster than the others. To help you better, here are 5 common encryption algorithms that are most undoubtedly unbreakable:</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_5KFESSAO_H1_Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;li&gt;Triple DES – it is a symmetric key method for data encryption. It uses the same key to encipher and decipher messages.&lt;/li&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_5KFESSAO_H1_Text4" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;li&gt;RSA – it uses an asymmetric method of encrypting data. In other words, it uses multiple keys for encrypting and decrypting data. These keys are commonly known as “public key” and “private key”.&lt;/li&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_5KFESSAO_H1_Text5" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;li&gt;Blowfish – it is a symmetric but general-purpose algorithm. It is highly prevalent in cryptographic software because of its speed, flexibility, and competitiveness, among other encryption algorithms.&lt;/li&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_5KFESSAO_H1_Text6" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;li&gt;Twofish – it is a brainchild of Blowfish. It is also flexible and uses a symmetric encryption method. However, Twofish encrypts data of up to 256-bit, while its predecessor only encrypts data of up to 64-bit.&lt;/li&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_5KFESSAO_H1_Text7" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;li&gt;AES – also a symmetric encryption algorithm, it became popular because of its easy implementation. Compared to other competitors, it has a more complex algorithm and is considered to be more effective.&lt;/li&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_5KFESSAO_H2_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>For some, encrypting data, such as their files’ content, is already enough to ensure its security. However, if you only encrypt the actual data stored, unauthorized users may still have access to view file names, archives, and the like.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_5KFESSAO_H2_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Besides, other people may derive information from having access to your file names. And for someone who wants to protect sensitive company files and other personal data, this can be quite worrisome.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_5KFESSAO_H2_Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>For this reason, it is crucial that your encryption software has a feature that lets you encrypt file names. This feature should prevent other people from seeing your file name and require them with a key or password before accessing it. If you want an extra layer of protection to your files, the file name encryption feature can undoubtedly come in handy.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_5KFESSAO_H2_Text4" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>On a different note, you might want to check out this article about the various human errors that impact data security.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_5KFESSAO_H3_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>As much as you want to protect all the information from your current files, you might also want to protect the data from the files that you want to discard. Since this information may contain sensitive or relevant content to your other files, it is vital to ensure their protection up to the deletion process.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_5KFESSAO_H3_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Hence, when selecting an encryption software, consider looking for a secure deletion feature that lets you securely delete files and wipe free space. Remember that with secure deletion, you can ensure that your files can no longer be restored or retrieved. This way, sensitive data is highly protected and prevents outsiders from accessing these discarded files. Hence, your &lt;a href='https://comparecamp.com/file-management-software/'&gt;file management software should have tight security features&lt;/a&gt;.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_5KFESSAO_H4_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Passwords are extremely valuable, most especially when you are protecting confidential information or projects. These days, however, hackers are more persistent and can obtain passwords quickly. But, what a better way to protect data more effectively than the implementation of a two-factor authentication functionality?</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_5KFESSAO_H4_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>As of June 2019, a study from &lt;a href='https://www.statista.com/statistics/1031900/identity-management-tools-used-in-us-organizations/'&gt;Statista&lt;/a&gt; shows that 62% of security-aware IT professionals in</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_5KFESSAO_H4_Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>North America stated that their company uses two-factor authentication to verify their identity. On the other hand, 52% use a single-on.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_5KFESSAO_H4_Text4" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>This feature should be one of the top things you should consider before committing to a specific encryption software. Adding an extra layer of security not only strengthens security, but it also reduces the risk of cyber breaches to help you build secure online relationships. This can help your company become more credible; hence, it allows you to create a trustworthy reputation among your customers.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_5KFESSAO_H5_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Typically, employees share relevant and work-related information with each other. However, worrying about the data’s security during the sharing process is inevitable. Since this raises concern about sharing secured files, it is incredibly vital for an encryption software to have a feature that lets you share and receive files more securely.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_5KFESSAO_H5_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>With the key sharing feature, you can share files without the need to share passwords. Instead, you can share file keys to specific colleagues to give them access to particular files. Then, they can easily browse or edit the shared file. Even more so, it should allow you to unshare the file to remove the person’s access quickly.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_5KFESSAO_H5_Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>In addition, one thing that you must bear in mind when it comes to file sharing is to avoid self-decrypting files. Often, these are self-contained executable files. However, since these contain strongly encrypted information, screening for anti-virus is almost impossible. To learn more, you can read this article about why you should avoid self-decrypting files.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_5KFESSAO_H6_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The purpose of encryption software does not only focus on ensuring highly secured data. It also allows you to determine the threats that you might encounter beforehand and help you avoid them in the long run. The best file encryption software should have the ability to meet all of your requirements and provide additional functionalities that can come in handy.</value>

    <value>When you discuss encryption with someone who isn't a security expert, you'll typically get a number of responses. Encryption is frequently misunderstood as some kind of sinister technology. Instead, encryption can help in achieving flexibility, compliance, and data privacy that today's virtual age requires.  </value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_ADGE_H1_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Encryption is the process of transforming plain text into ciphertext, or changing readable text into unreadable text, in order to protect data so that only certain people can access it. Encryption scrambles, or encrypts data and then utilises a key to unscramble or decrypt the information for the receiving party. It proves to be a successful method of safeguarding sensitive data.

    <value>Intercepting emails and other content is just one example of a number of incidents that have occurred in less formal methods. While most emails do not pique the curiosity of other parties enough for them to try to intercept it, there have been instances where this has happened. Emails are not encrypted by default as they travel from your servers to the recipient. This implies that if hackers gain access to this information, they will be able to view your emails and confidential information.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</value>

    <value>According to a data breach report, employees are directly or indirectly responsible for 34 percent of total attacks. Content can be misappropriated by disgruntled employees or contractors for their own or others' benefit. Any intentional loophole can bring down a whole organization with millions of stolen data. This danger can be mitigated by imposing the appropriate set of access rules to keep privileged users in their “swim lanes”. For instance, the Master Key feature eliminates the risk of losing access to critical files. Check out AxCrypt´s &lt;a href='https://www.axcrypt.net/information/master-key'&gt;Master Key feature here&lt;/a&gt;.</value>

    <value>If the data is not encrypted, the most significant consequence will be the compromise of critical or confidential information by a cyber attack or interference of a third party. If protocols aren't in place to identify any kind of behaviour, organisations can lose large amounts of data before realising it.</value>

    <value>With more businesses moving to the cloud, security measures must be constantly checked and updated to protect data from leaks.

    <value>To begin the process of encryption, you need to collect the data you intend to encrypt. The algorithm will then use the encryption key to modify the data in the input and send the result. The output would be a scrambled text that could only be read by the person with the key; you could then transfer the output to the second party via any medium, or preserve the encrypted data for future use. Keys are usually generated with random number generators, or computer algorithms.&lt;br/&gt;</value>

    <value>Mobile Encryption with AxCrypt</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_AMEFH_SH1_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Mobile encryption goes above and beyond a regular lock screen password. It is a one-stop for safeguarding all of your personal information and data on your mobile phones from prying eyes or if your mobile gets lost or stolen. Encryption stores your phone's information in an unreadable, jumbled format that can only be read with the correct credentials. This means that if your phone falls into the wrong hands, no one will be able to decipher any of the data unless they know your password.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_AMEFH_SH1_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>From saving your data from getting compromised to making your personal details super-secret, mobile encryption can do it all for you. A misplaced or abandoned device poses a significant security risk; particularly if it lacks a strong PIN or password, as well as full data encryption. Sensitive documents and files in the device will be vulnerable to theft. If an encrypted device, on the other hand, falls into the wrong hands or is lost, the owner may rest assured that his or her data is secure and will not be viewed by outsiders without the key.</value>

    <value>AxCrypt Mobile Encryption is Finally here!</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_AOVO_H2_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>We store what we call an AxCrypt ID which is associated with your account on our servers. (Technically this is an RSA-4096 encryption key pair.) This key pair consists of a public sharing and private secret part. When we encrypt a file we don’t really encrypt it with your password as the encryption key. We encrypt your file with a random and unique key every time a file is encrypted. We call this the master file key. It’s this master file key that we actually encrypt with your password and add to the encrypted file. We also encrypt this same master file key with your public sharing key from your AxCrypt ID, as well as the public sharing keys of any additional recipients you may have added with the key sharing feature.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_AOVO_H2_Text10" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;li&gt;Any private secret key corresponding to a public sharing key used to encrypt the master file key as described above.&lt;/li&gt;</value>

  <data name="Blog_AOVO_H2_Text11" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;em&gt;On the AxCrypt server, we store yours and everyone else’s AxCrypt IDs which consists of the public sharing key, and your private secret key – encrypted as an AxCrypt file using only your password to encrypt the master file key for that file.&lt;/em&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_AOVO_H2_Text12" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Finally, we can tell you what the server is used for!</value>

If you change your password on our server, we’ll re-encrypt your private key there with the new password and this means that all your already encrypted files will now be decryptable with the new password! Very convenient. You can still also decrypt them with the original password used when the file was encrypted of course.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_AOVO_H2_Text2" xml:space="preserve">

  </data>
  <data name="Blog_AOVO_H2_Text7" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The unique thing about public sharing and private secret key pairs is that while anyone can *encrypt* data with the public sharing key, only the person knowing the private secret part can *decrypt*, and even knowing the public sharing key it’s not possible to figure out the private secret key.</value>

    <value>There’s also an online password manager, where we can keep track of all of your passwords encrypted with your AxCrypt password.

  <data name="Blog_AOVO_H4_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Since some of the features of AxCrypt are reserved for paying Premium users, we need to know if you have a valid Premium subscription.

    <value>Security concerns are frequently of the utmost importance in an age where cybercrime is the most prevalent vice. People from many walks of life are working hard to discover solutions that not only offer the finest protection but also easy-to-use techniques in response to data breaches and other concerns. Despite repeated recommendations against using overly simple passwords or recycling the same password, a recent Pew Research Center survey found that people are still at risk of damaging personal data breaches that could result in identity or financial theft due to poor password management and a lack of digital security practices.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_BMYP_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The majority of people have confirmed that they frequently use passwords that are identical to or strikingly similar to one another. Others acknowledge employing short, uncomplicated passwords that are simple to remember. The best way to remember passwords is to memorize them, followed by the conventional pen and paper method of noting essential things in the diary. Simple passwords or even ones that are similar can be quickly guessed, and writing them down in a journal makes things worse because they can be easily stolen. One of Axcrypt's key features, a password manager, may be the solution to your cyber security worries.</value>

    <value>Benefits Of Managing Your Passwords</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_BSTSSCE_H1_SH1_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Use a virtual private network (VPN). VPNs are used to protect private web traffic from snooping, interference, and censorship. PNs encrypt all the data you send over the internet. Your VPN also masks your IP address and finally some VPNs block malicious websites, ads, and trackers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_BSTSSCE_H1_SH2_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Strong passwords are the key to your digital life. Passwords are the digital keys to our networks of friends, our work colleagues, and even our banking and payment services. The most important two passwords are those for your email and social network accounts. It’s important to use entirely new and unique passwords for each account you might run, so you avoid compromising your data if one of your accounts gets hacked. To have a strong password it is extremely important not to include any personal information in your passwords. Hackers could attempt to log on to your account by guessing your password based off of personal information gained from your security questions. The shorter and less complex your password is, the quicker it can be to come up with the correct combination of characters and access your private information. A password cracker is a programme using a multitude of combinations in a very small amount of time until gaining full access to whatever your password was protecting. Use a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, symbols and numbers.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_BSTSSCE_H1_SH2_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And don’t forget - if in need of inspiration you can use our password generator. Based on statistical analysis of actual text, it produces strong passwords that are not nonsensical and actually possible to remember and type. You’ll get three suggestions of decreasing strength and complexity.

    <value>End-to-end encryption gives you back control and protects your data from snoopers and prying eyes. Encryption is the best working way so far to secure your data of any form of unwanted access. By taking plain text and using mathematical calculations to turn data into code it is converted into cipher text, only those who have the special key can decrypt your files.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_BSTSSCE_H1_SH4_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Premium and business customers have access to our extra strong encryption method: AES-256. The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) 256 is adopted by federal agencies like the National Security Agency (NSA) where national security is involved. AES-256  is the strongest, most secure and most efficient encryption algorithm available nowadays. AES uses symmetric key encryption: one secret key is used to cipher and decipher. Symmetric keys are better suited to internal encryption, faster and in need of less computational power it is therefore an effective mechanism. The plaintext, which is the information to be encrypted, is divided into sections of 256-bit block size after a few rounds of substitutions, permutations and linear transformations the data is transformed into code. The size of the encrypted data remains the same: 256 bits of plaintext yields 256 bits of ciphertext.</value>

    <value>&lt;h3&gt;Some Characteristics of the Cloud&lt;/h3&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_CEANK_H1_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The cloud is a network that refers to all the data servers that are placed all over the world including their software and database sometimes operated offshore. It permits users to access the same files or applications anywhere at any time via the Internet as the information is stored on the servers instead of local devices such as computers or phones. The files are moreover stored various times on distinct data centers so that the information remains available if any problem should occur. Over time, businesses switched to cloud computing removing in that way some costs and the endeavor of taking care and maintaining their own servers.This convenient, on-demand network does not crack, gets lost or stolen. The cloud is a promising technology that enables collaboration, flexibility, reliability and high productivity.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_CEANK_H2_SH1_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Providers rent out basic storage capacity on virtual servers according to their need instead of buying an expensive hardware. Exemples for that can be SaaS applications including Salesforce, MailChimp, and Slack. SaaS is like renting a house: the landlord maintains the house, but the tenant mostly gets to use it.&lt;br/&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_CEANK_H2_SH2_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Businesses pay for development tools, infrastructure and operating systems they need to to build their own application to then upload it on their devices. Heroku and Microsoft Azure belong to the PaaS categorie. PaaS can be compared to renting all the tools and equipment necessary for building a house.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_CEANK_H2_SH3_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>In this model, a company rents the servers and storage they need from a cloud provider. They then use that cloud infrastructure to build their applications. IaaS providers include DigitalOcean, Google Compute Engine, and OpenStack. IaaS is like a company leasing a plot of land.</value>

  <data name="Blog_CEANK_H4_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Personal data is any information relating to an identifiable person. Examples for that could be name, address, occupation, income, political opinions, healthcare information and IP address of course.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_CEANK_H4_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Our Swedish company takes privacy law as a matter of hearth. Business or private customers have the right to ask about the level of privacy your personal data has when stored in the cloud. Moreover if you work and deal with data of European citizens, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) comes into effect and therefore it is important to be well informed. The GDPR is clearly in favour of encryption as the European Commission conferred that data protection outside the EU is not effective enough, Switzerland is nevertheless a rare exception. The US politic through data protection is a political subject that divides the population. Because of the Patriot Act, authorities have the right to inspect intensively personal data without even a court order. Problem is then that most of the cloud providers companies such as Dropbox, Microsoft, or Google are affiliated on US ground.</value>

  <data name="Blog_CHHSSO_H3_SH2_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Encryption transforms plain text into ciphertext or converts readable text into unreadable text to protect data so that only certain people can access it. Encryption scrambles or encrypts data and then utilizes a key to unscramble or decrypt the information for the receiving party. It proves to be a successful method of safeguarding sensitive data. Data on computers and storage devices and data in transit through networks are all protected with encryption.</value>

  <data name="Blog_CHHSSO_H3_SH3_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>It is essential to have secure passwords for all of your devices. Your passwords should be unique and complicated, with at least 12 characters, including numbers, capital, lowercase letters, and symbols. Changing your passwords regularly — will help keep hackers at bay. AxCrypt provides a password management generator that ensures their passwords are strong and secure.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_CHHSSO_H3_SH4_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Backups should be kept in a distinct location from the originals and tested regularly. To securely save personal files, create a backup on a separate device (e.g., the cloud or an encrypted USB). You can encrypt your drive data with AxCrypt, which encrypts data in transit, rest, and storage. In addition, you retain control over your encryption keys, allowing you to keep command even after data has left your building.</value>

  </data>
  <data name="Blog_CRI_H1_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>It is crucial for an organization to create a more robust cyber strategy to resist the flood of threats and attacks from all over the world. Cyber resilience is the capacity to foresee, tolerate, and recover from any cyberthreats and data breaches. They also control system attacks through online resources. The main aim of cyber resilience is to secure organizational functionality and endure all the crises, dangers, adversities, emergencies and difficulties that are both known and unforeseen. Cyber resilience is a new security paradigm that stimulates a proactive security strategy including planning, responding, and recovering from cyber-attacks without affecting regular business operations, business continuity and business acceleration.</value>

  <data name="Blog_CRI_H2_SH1_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;strong&gt;Augmented Systems Security:&lt;/strong&gt;Cyber ​​resilience is not only used for responding to and surviving an attack, but also helps in developing strategies for improvising IT governance, critical asset security and data privacy. Resilience also helps in avoiding the various outcomes faced due to natural disasters or reducing human error.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_CRI_H2_SH1_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;strong&gt;Minimal Financial Loss:&lt;/strong&gt;One of the main advantages of cyber resilience is decreased downtime and financial losses. Cyber resilience provides a plan which helps minimize business disruption and hence reduce financial losses in a timely and accurate manner.</value>

    <value>In today's modern world, cyberattacks like malware, phishing, password and SQL injection attacks have increased enormously. The main target of hackers is stealing or deleting confidential data from a computer network, database, or personal devices. According to Cybersecurity Ventures, it is said, by 2025 cybercrime will cost the global economy $10.5 trillion every year. And it is very vital to develop a strong reaction to this issue given the scope of this criminal conduct. Cyber-attacks are so crucial that they can disable, destroy or disrupt computer systems. They can even control the entire system and can change, modify, block, erase, or steal the data stored within.

  <data name="Blog_CWELTI_Conclusion_H1_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Perhaps the biggest vulnerabilities that public key cryptography faces are people accidentally losing their keys or revealing their private key to other people.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_CWELTI_Conclusion_H1_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>First of all, a person should never share his or private key information with anyone. Hardware wallets can add an extra layer of security. It completely removes one's cryptocurrencies from the internet for storage in a similar way that flash drives remove information from a computer for storage off of the computer. Companies also sell insurances helping cryptocurrency holders from experiencing major losses if a cryptocurrency exchange is hacked.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_CWELTI_Conclusion_H1_Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>However, because technology tends to improve over time, it is possible that someone could invent a system that is even better than public key cryptography. If this happens, then many of the main cryptocurrencies will probably be updated to incorporate the developments. This could make cryptocurrencies even more secure, hypothetically.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_CWELTI_Conclusion_H1_Text4" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>As more and more people start to use cryptocurrencies, a larger percentage of the population will start to understand just how valuable public key cryptography and cryptocurrencies are. Part of the reason why all of this cryptography technology is being developed is because there is an increased need to store, send, and receive money securely on the internet. Online banking and ecommerce are driving this need. Business and banking are both more efficient when money can safely be transferred online. Public key cryptography is doing a lot to make digital money exchanging and storing safer. Because public key cryptography and cryptocurrencies are helping to improve digital money use and storage, it is very likely that cryptocurrencies will continue to rise in popularity significantly over the next few decades.</value>

    <value>How to protect your private key?</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_CWELTI_H1_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>A cryptocurrency, or crypto, is decentralized digital money based on blockchain technology. A digital asset based on a network that is distributed across a large number of computers, cryptocurrency is secured by cryptography, which makes it nearly impossible to counterfeit or double-spend. It can be used as a form of payment to buy goods and services, but also as an investment. As this type of currency is unregulated, buyers like to trade it for profit as they would in other assets like stocks and precious metals.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_CWELTI_H2_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>There is no central authority that fixes and maintains the value of crypto. It is a medium of exchange that is digital, encrypted and decentralized. That cryptographic proof comes in the form of transactions that are verified and recorded in a form of program called a blockchain. More than 6,700 different cryptocurrencies are traded publicly, the most popular being Bitcoin and Ethereum. Most supporters of crypto like the fact that these currencies, apart from being decentralized and more secured throughout the process of blockchain, remove central banks from managing the money supply securing it from government interference and manipulation. Many companies have issued their own currencies, often called tokens, and these can be traded specifically for the good or service that the company provides.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_CWELTI_H3_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>A blockchain is an open, distributed ledger that records transactions in code enforced by a disparate network of computers. Blockchains are organizational methods for ensuring the integrity of transactional data and play a major role within cryptocurrency exchanges.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_CWELTI_H3_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>A database is a collection of information that is stored electronically on a computer system. Data needs to be structured, and if needed, filtered, to find specific information.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_CWELTI_H3_Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Blockchains differ from specific databases, where data is stored in blocks and chained together. As new data comes in it is entered into a fresh block. Once the block is filled with data it is chained onto the previous block, which chains the data together in chronological order.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_CWELTI_H3_Text4" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Different types of information can be stored on a blockchain but the most common use so far has been as a ledger for transactions. In Bitcoin's case, blockchain is used in a decentralized way so that no single person or group has control. Rather, all users collectively retain control. Decentralized blockchains are immutable, which means that the data entered is irreversible. For Bitcoin, this means that transactions are permanently recorded and viewable to anyone.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_CWELTI_H4_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>One of the advantages of cryptocurrency is that the transfers are made easy and exclude the use of a third party such as a bank or credit card company. The exchanges are secured and ensured by public or private keys. On the other hand, a significant disadvantage would be money laundering and tax evasion, making crypto transactions well suited for illegal activities.</value>

    <value>Cryptography implies the use of different encryption techniques which are used to secure a network. It is essentially the practice of encrypting certain data or information so that it can be kept secret from third parties. By converting your private information into a secret code that hides the information's true meaning, you make it almost impossible for an intruder to decrypt it into plaintext. When an encrypted message is intercepted by an unauthorized entity, the inflator has to guess the variables that were used to encrypt the message. The time and difficulty of guessing this information is what makes encryption such a valuable security tool.</value>

    <value>Cryptocurrencies use cryptography for three main purposes: to secure transactions, to control the creation of additional units, and to verify the transfer of assets. To accomplish all of these things, cryptocurrencies rely on what is called "public key cryptography".</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_CWELTI_H6_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The various encryption algorithms and cryptographic techniques that safeguard the specific entries are for example elliptical curve encryption, public-private key pairs, and hashing functions.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_CWELTI_H6_Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Public keys give an address to people on where to send the money to. It involves a user having both a public and private key, encrypted in an assortment of around 30 numbers and letters. The purpose of the private key is to unlock the public key in order to receive the money that has been sent. In this way, only the person who knows the private key can unlock the public key. Anyone can deposit money to a public key/address, but only people with the private key can access the money. This allows people to receive money without other people being able to access the money. Public key cryptography is a technological wonder and it is rapidly changing the online payment industry.</value>

By encrypting your data and making it unreadable you guarantee security and productivity. Even if intercepted, the message will be unreadable for any actor that doesn't possess the right key to decrypt it. For anyone who is a fan of cryptography, privacy, and security, these are very exciting times.

    <value>Cryptocurrency, why is encryption linked to it?</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_DEVFE_Conclusion_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The whole world has become internet-focused therefore, it is important to turn your attention towards data security. It is entirely up to you to determine which encryption approach is best for you.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_DEVFE_H1_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Nowadays it's more important than ever to keep information safe in this internet-connected society. Your data, whether it's personal or professional, is constantly at risk of slipping into the wrong hands, which is all the more reason to use the finest encryption software available. Data encryption is a crucial component of safeguarding data. It is the process of scrambling text (called ciphertext) to make it unreadable to an unauthorized user at the most basic level. Encryption can be applied to individual files, folders, volumes, or whole drives on a computer or USB device, as well as information in the cloud.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_DEVFE_H1_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Just as security tech is taking steps to increase the safety of your information, hackers are finding new ways around them as a result, to defeat them new encryption techniques are always being developed. Let’s dive into popular encryption methods, types, and how it can help you.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_DEVFE_H2_SH1_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>A file or folder encryption system encrypts particular folders, files, or volumes. This enables users to control who gets access to what information. it's a way of preserving large amounts of data or protecting sensitive data not just over the internet, but also in transit, usage, and storage. Since file encryption uses fewer resources, it has a lower impact on system performance. A file-based encryption system is akin to a lockbox kept in a bank vault. Even if the vault is broken into, each box has its own layer of protection within that requires concentrated effort to break. Similarly, if your device is hacked, lost, or stolen, a third party will be unable to open your files and folders since each file is encrypted and no one will be able to access them without the key. AxCrypt is an example of a free open-source files/folder encryption software available for Windows, Android, iOS, and even macOS. AxCrypt makes data more secure whether it is being transported or at rest. Users can take full control of their data.&lt;br/&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_DEVFE_H2_SH2_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Full disk encryption (FDE) is, as the name implies, encryption at the disk level. When data is written to or read from a disc, it is automatically encrypted. It encrypts all files on the hard drive, including the operating system and file system. It's only used to keep files safe while they're in storage or not in transit. Full disk encryption works in a similar way to locking a house's outer doors but not its internal rooms. Of course, it's a good idea to secure the front entrance so that attackers can't easily get access, but if they manage to enter, they'll have full access to everything inside. In the same way, disk encryption secures information as a whole by turning all of it into an unreadable code that is difficult for unauthorized individuals to understand.&lt;strong&gt;There are two main types of disk encryption, which we'll go over in detail below.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_DEVFE_H2_SH3_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>BitLocker is a full-disk encryption technology included in the newest Windows operating systems (Windows 10) that encrypts data on hard drives using AES (128 and 256-bit) encryption. When BitLocker Drive Encryption is activated, and the user adds new files, BitLocker will encrypt them automatically. BitLocker with TPM protection prevents out-of-OS alteration of boot components by using the Static Root of Trust Measurement. BitLocker requires the user to enter a recovery key only when disk corruption occurs, or when he or she loses the PIN or password.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_DEVFE_H2_SH4_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>FileVault is a full disk encryption feature from Apple built into macOS. FileVault, like BitLocker for Windows, provides robust encryption for files and data on Mac computers, safeguarding the whole disk and all of the contents on it. When FileVault is turned on, it operates quietly in the background, encrypting all device data on the fly and without causing any interruptions.</value>

  </data>
  <data name="Blog_DEVFE_H3_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Both BitLocker and FileVault are disk encryption software that functions in the same way but on different operating systems. Both are for safeguarding data on workstations and mobile devices at storage and are capable of encrypting entire hard drives,including both system and data drives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_DEVFE_H3_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>FileVault full-disk encryption (FileVault 2) uses XTS-AES-128 encryption with a 256-bit key to help prevent unauthorized access to the information on macOS. FileVault encodes the information stored on your Mac so that it can’t be read unless the login password is entered.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_DEVFE_H3_Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>BitLocker supports encrypted hard drives with built-in encryption hardware, allowing administrators to manage them using the same BitLocker administration tools. File-based encryption is transparent encryption that fills in the gaps where full disk encryption falls short. When BitLocker is enabled on a system drive and the PC has a TPM, you can choose to require that users type a PIN before BitLocker will unlock the drive. With disk encryption, the data is only protected for as long as it’s on the disk; if a user removes a file from an encrypted device, that file is no longer secured. Furthermore, if the entire system is physically hacked, disk encryption is unreliable. As a result, for the vast majority of cases, the file-based encryption approach is the best option.</value>

  <data name="Blog_DEVFE_H3_Text4" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>AxCrypt works with file encryption and it's best for protecting data on cloud storage and when you like to share your encrypted data. AxCrypt uses 256-bit encryption to protect your data at all three phases of its lifecycle: at rest, in transit, and in use. AxCrypt allows secured files to be opened by other AxCrypt users with their own passwords and it's also easier to safeguard your online assets. AxCrypt automatically encrypts data on Google Drive, Dropbox, and other cloud storage providers. Users may send an encrypted file via email, which means that even if the email is hacked, the encrypted file will not be compromised, and it can be accessed only with a unique key. In addition, it provides a collaboration tool that allows users to share secured files and data with other users with key sharing features.

    <value>Nowadays, data plays a very important role, especially for businesses and organizations. There are different types of data and the data can be outlined into different categories, such as financial data, statistical data or scientific data. Furthermore, data can be categorized into two different subcategories, structured and unstructured data. Structured data can be read and interpreted by humans, i.e. transactional data, personal data or web data, whereas unstructured data is data that computer programs process.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_DRATIUIN_H2_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Data can be used in many different ways. For example, data collection can be especially beneficial for companies and organizations. The collection of data can be used to gain a better understanding of customers needs, behaviours and churn. The problem is that many firms have too much data and then have issues finding the right data to analyse. Furthermore, data can contain sensitive information that companies or individuals do not want to share with anyone else. Sensitive data that contains your important, private information should be encrypted at all times. Therefore, AxCrypt offers you features that secure your data. These features include, for instance, key sharing, a password manager, password generator and strong AES-256 encryption.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_DRATIUIN_H3_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Data at rest, at transit and in use are part of the three states of data. The different states of data also show different issues of how data can be attacked by hackers. Data at rest is described as data that is not moving around, for instance, when data is stored on a laptop, hard drive, or flash drive. To protect data at rest, it is helpful and beneficial to use AxCrypt encryption. It will protect your stored data in various places, for example, on your computer, in the cloud with AxCrypt´s Cloud Storage awareness, and on your smartphone. If the data is left unprotected, hackers will be able to find a way to get to your data, because data in rest is usually considered to be more valuable than data in transit.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_DRATIUIN_H3_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Data at transit is constantly moving through the internet. This includes sending emails, uploading documents to a cloud and browsing the internet. In the transit phase, data is often less secure, making it easier for hackers to get access to your data. Therefore, using AxCrypt encryption is a major advantage when sending data from one network to another.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_DRATIUIN_H3_Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Data in use refers to active data that is being processed by applications. In the data in use stage the data is more vulnerable and therefore many businesses and organizations are concerned because of the sensitive data that can be accessed by hackers if the data in use is not protected. Moreover, a major problem is that when hackers have access to the random access memory (RAM) it is easier for them to get access to the memory and therefore can decrypt encrypted data at rest. In order to protect data in use, it is important to encrypt the memory, but also to use tools that make sure only validated people can access the data</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_DRATIUIN_H4_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>There is a constant risk for sensitive data to be accessed by hackers. Whether the data is in transit, at rest or in use, it is important to protect the data. One way of making sure that this data does not get accessed by a hacker is Encryption. Encryption is essential to assure that sensitive data does not get stolen or intercepted by an outsider. More and more businesses and Organizations start encrypting their data before they move it from one network to another.  With AxCrypt's key sharing feature, you can allow your colleagues to open secured files with their own password.</value>

  <data name="Blog_EAB_H1_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Quite frequently we get requests for integrating various forms of biometrics into AxCrypt instead of, or as complements to the password. The problem here is that properly designed encryption systems assume an attacker has huge resources and full knowledge of everything. Except one single piece of information: the decryption key. This is all that must be kept secret, and it must also be kept secret. Everything depends on this key being secret. In AxCrypt terms the password is ultimately the key that must be secret.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_EAB_H1_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>A fingerprint is unique, but it is not secret and it cannot be changed. It is entirely unsuitable to use directly or indirectly as an encryption key.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_EAB_H1_Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>It is possible to do what mobile device manufacturers do, to use internal trusted hardware as the guardian of the secret keys which will only release the secrets if authenticated by for example a fingerprint. This is how Apple Touch ID works. But, remember the caveats of biometric authentication mentioned above. The internal trusted hardware can always be fooled by a sufficiently well made device or artifact, and frequently the required fingerprint is even found all over the device itself!</value>

  <data name="Blog_EAB_Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;ol style='list-style-position: inside;display: grid;gap: 20%;'&gt;&lt;li&gt;If there is no other human actually watching you ‘apply’ the biometric, it’s really hard to ensure that the biometric is really attached to the real person. Think 3D-model of face, or chopped off thumb :-( .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You can’t change your face or your fingerprint, and it’s not a secret, so once that knowledge is in the wrong hands it’s a technological arms race against physical and electronic spoofing devices such as fake thumbs or thumbprint reader bypass technology just to name a few. You’re for ever stuck with your face and your fingers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_EAB_Text4" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>This makes it pretty clear that pure biometric authentication is only suitable when the asset being protected is of sufficiently low value that an attacker will not find the cost and risk of bypassing it worthwhile.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_EAB_Text5" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The current trend of incorporating fingerprint authentication in mobile devices is troubling. The value represented by a modern mobile device, including the assets potentially reachable indirectly such as online accounts, could easily make spoofing worthwhile. In some parts of the world it does not require too much imagination to envision people being robbed not only of their phones as today, but of a fingertip at the same time tomorrow.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_EAB_Text6" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>We already have a situation where identity theft is a major headache. But this can actually be handled, even if the process is hampered by outdated systems and laws. If biometrics continue to gain headway, we may get a group of people who will never fully integrate into society since their biometrics once stolen can never by recovered or changed. The theft may occur individually, or from corporate or government databases.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_EAB_Text7" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>While the likelyhood of a national or corporate fingerprint database leaking is perhaps low, it’s not zero. With time it will happen. Once it’s happened it can never be undone.</value>

    <value>In ransom attacks, hackers take a company's data then encrypt it so they can't access it anymore. Cybercriminals will then blackmail the firm by threatening to reveal its confidential information unless a ransom is paid. In 2017, ransomware attacks grew considerably. However, in the current environment, the threat of ransomware is becoming much more serious as technology advances.</value>

    <value>The first important future trend will be how user-controlled encryption—that is, systems in which consumers or end-users have complete control over the keys to encrypt and decode data—will be embraced across platforms and widely utilized applications, such as WhatsApp and Signal. The adoption of user-controlled encryption systems is one of the key things they're talking about in the context of “going dark”, and it's something that law enforcement is really interested in. User-controlled encryption will make accessing some data difficult or impossible for law enforcement. However, as the study points out, such encryption will not be employed everywhere since various users have different encryption demands and methodologies. The same may be said for service providers. Some clients want to know that their information will be safe even if their service provider is hacked encryption. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_EFPECT_H2_SH2_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>In the next few years, workstations that contain data that must be kept safe for lengthy periods of time after initial encryption will require post-quantum cryptography. Quantum computers are extremely difficult to construct. None has yet been constructed that can outperform a traditional computer, despite many attempts. But according to the article, quantum machines might become a reality within the next 10 to 20 years. Quantum cryptography, unlike mathematical encryption, employs quantum physics to convey secure data and is genuinely unhackable. Quantum cryptography is a quantum mechanics-based approach for safeguarding the distribution of symmetric encryption keys. Quantum key distribution is a more accurate term for it (QKD). The different QKD techniques are designed to ensure that any eavesdropper attempting to monitor the transmitted photons would cause the transmission to be disrupted.</value>

    <value>Due to a lack of encrypted medical data, health insurance information, and social security numbers are all exposed to third parties. Protect your company's and patients' information with AxCrypt.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_EHI_H1_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>There have been plenty of high-profile data breaches in the healthcare industry over the past five years. Without getting into the nuance of each situation, the result has been hundreds of millions of patient records being compromised and potentially sold on the dark web. The Anthem incident in 2015 is just one example. .&lt;br/&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_EHI_H1_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The healthcare sector comprises not just hospitals and pharmacies, but also research centers and laboratories. All of them contain sensitive information on patients, medical reports, and data regarding medical research; for instance, Coronavirus studies and vaccines. As technology advances, cybercriminals become more sophisticated; sensitive information can fall into the wrong hands if it isn't adequately protected. Therefore, the need for encryption has become more prevalent in hospitals, nursing homes, and rehabilitation facilities. Healthcare organizations must establish comprehensive security measures to safeguard data from growing numbers of threats in order to properly secure delicate information from hackers.&lt;br/&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_EHI_H2_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Since the global pandemic, the healthcare industry experienced a 51% increase in the total volume of records exposed. In the first half of 2021, data breaches grew further; with the healthcare sector remaining at the top of the most-breached industry list.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_EHI_H2_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Healthcare companies cannot rely on basic security measures like firewalls and passwords to protect themselves from modern hackers and cyber-criminals. This issue will persist and continue to jeopardize countless lives until up-to-date security measures are adopted in the healthcare sector.</value>

  <data name="Blog_EHI_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Healthcare is a global sector that continuously processes and transmits large volumes of vital information on a regular basis through a variety of channels and facilities. Due to the pandemic and growth in digitalization, healthcare data and practices have steadily adopted more electronic and automated formats. Every day, the amount of healthcare data transmitted and processed is calculated in terabytes.  As a result, healthcare data has become the main focus for security breaches and cybercrime.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_EHI_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>According to a Stanford University white paper, medical data is growing at a rate of 48% each year. Private information on patients, their health state, and insurance providers that circulate in a hospital or doctor's office fall under this category. The patients' sensitive information requires a high level of protection.</value>

    <value>Encryption in the healthcare industry</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_EIAWII_H1_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>One aspect of the bill which has sparked significant uproar and critique is the eradication of Section 230 in regards to abusive material. Section 230 is a law which shields internet companies from being held liable for the content posted by their users. For example, if an individual user posts illegal content on Facebook, the owners of Facebook will not be held liable for this illegal act. Under the EARN IT Act, however, companies will no longer be subject to this protection.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_EIAWII_H1_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>As explained by the American Civil Liberties Union, companies will respond to the subsequent increase in the liability cost of providing an online service by passing this cost on to consumers. This will be materialised through increased surveillance and screening of private messages, in an attempt for companies to avoid expensive lawsuits. As a result, censorship is promoted and freedom of speech on the internet becomes limited.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_EIAWII_H2_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Another significant caveat to this bill is the necessary creation of backdoors. A backdoor when speaking about encryption is essentially a built-in feature which allows an agent to bypass the encryption. In this case, the backdoor feature will provide the government the ability to evade all security that an individual has placed on their device, enabling easy access to personal data.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_EIAWII_H2_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>This act will impact all users of the internet within United States borders, irrespective of whether the government is interested in your data or not. When backdoors are introduced, ill-intentioned agents are also provided an opportunity to retrieve your data. As stated by the Electronic Frontier Foundation, “either the message remains private to everyone but its recipients, or it is available to others”. On the other side of the argument, many feel that this is a necessary condition for ensuring national security and ease of federal investigations.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_EIAWII_H3_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The United States government and larger tech companies have long been in a standoff in regards to data privacy and the government’s right to access encrypted information. You may remember the dispute between Apple and the FBI in the San Bernardino case. Apple refused to create a backdoor for the federal agency, rendering it incredibly challenging for the FBI to access the shooter’s phone. Apple came to this conclusion as they felt creating a backdoor “would set a dangerous precedent” for the encrypted material of all iPhone users.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_EIAWII_H3_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>A similar conclusion has been drawn by the public in the wake of this bill. Many worry that the EARN IT Act will create a dangerous landscape for all individuals, not just criminals being chased by the FBI.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_EIAWII_H4_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The current worldwide pandemic has made encryption more paramount than ever before. Individuals and companies alike have increased their reliance on digital platforms to conduct their day-to-day operations. This has meant that there is a greater risk as the threat landscape becomes wider. Encryption is now increasingly necessary in preventing criminals from using the pandemic for commercial gain and accessing personal data. Therefore, if there was ever a time to invest in encryption and ensure the security of your data, it is now.</value>

    <value>Strong passwords are the key to your digital life. Passwords are the digital keys to our networks of friends, our work colleagues, and even our banking and payment services. The most important two passwords are those for your email and social network accounts. It’s important to use entirely new and unique passwords for each account you might run, so you avoid compromising your data if one of your accounts gets hacked. To have a strong password it is extremely important not to include any personal information in your passwords. Hackers could attempt to log on to your account by guessing your password based off of personal information gained from your security questions. The shorter and less complex your password is, the quicker it can be to come up with the correct combination of characters and access your private information. A password cracker is a programme using a multitude of combinations in a very small amount of time until gaining full access to whatever your password was protecting. Use a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, symbols and numbers.</value>

    <value>In the world of finance, data security is a serious business. Encryption enables various types of economic activities that would otherwise not be possible. The financial services industry is one hit hardest by the heightened expectations of consumers to access information, receive help, and conduct transactions anywhere and at any time via their electronic devices. By converting plaintext into ciphertext, encryption helps banks, insurance companies, actors in the credit market, corporations, venture funds, investment advisors, fund managers, consulting firms etc. protect sensitive information so only the authorized users can, with the right key, decrypt and understand the information.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_EIBM_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>It should come as no surprise that the financial industry is among the most regulated in the world. Electronic banking, a drastic change, has revolutionized the financial industry and therefore new regulations have been put in place to avoid possible fraudulent transactions. The development of cryptographic techniques has seen a lot of applications in the banking industry for the implementation of data security. Encryption of private information and data provides security in the form of a password, pin code, biometrics, digital signature, steganography, etc.</value>

    <value>With 256-bit encryption, AxCrypt increases data security and reduces risks of breaches. AxCrypt allows secured files to be opened by other AxCrypt users with their own password. AxCrypt automatically detects and creates an it’s own folder in any Cloud Storage services that are installed on your PC. Master key is an important feature that allows business managers to recover files from other members of the company. No data will ever be lost owing to employees quitting or forgetting their passwords as long as the company has administrators who keep track of their credentials. AxCrypt ensures that your organization stays compliant with regulations like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</value>

    <value>Businesses and consumers can employ encryption to protect themselves from government eavesdropping, rendering any attempts to decrypt correspondence or intellectual property. If the information is encrypted, law enforcement and government agencies cannot access it without obtaining the key from the data owner, therefore the government prohibits enterprises from using proper encrypted communications.</value>

    <value>Companies are vulnerable to cyber attacks if they do not comprehend modern technology or recognise the need of data protection. It is widely assumed that privacy of data is only necessary when someone has something to hide but it is not the only motive.</value>

  <data name="Blog_EITPS_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;i&gt;According to security and privacy specialist Bruce Schneier, “Encryption works best if it is ubiquitous and automatic. It should be enabled for everything by default, not a feature you only turn on when you’re doing something you consider worth protecting.”&lt;/i&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_EITPS_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Companies are vulnerable to cyber attacks if they do not comprehend modern technology or recognise the need of data protection. It is widely assumed that privacy of data is only necessary when someone has something to hide but it is not the only motive. Securing data also assists in resolving the encroaching issues of privacy and protection that both customers and companies face, as well as deterring cybercriminals who seek to steal data from the internet as no company or individual is immune to security breaches.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_EITPS_Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Encryption converts information or data into a code that is difficult to decipher by third parties. When an encoded message is intercepted by an unauthorized entity, the inflator has to guess the variables that were used in the coding. The time and difficulty of guessing this information is what makes it a valuable security tool. This coding ensures that your private or corporate data is secured even if hackers get past a firewall. Recent studies show that encryption is increasing across all industries, with 48 percent of businesses adopting some form of encryption policy.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_EITPS_Title" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Encryption isn’t the problem, it’s the solution</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_EVA_H1_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Access control is when a given identity is given permissions by a higher authority (is authorized) to perform actions such as reading a file.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_EVA_H1_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>For access control to work, we need authentication to ensure that the identity claim is actually authentic. Simply put – that I am who I claim to be. We also need someone to perform that authentication – typically an operating system or a server.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_EVA_H1_Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>When you limit access to a file using access control, such as when you store a file on a network server or in your cloud storage, it’s the responsibility of the operating system or cloud storage server to ask you for credentials (like a password) to prove who you are, and then to enforce the restrictions that you have set on your files. The authentication can be made stronger by for example 2 factor authentication.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_EVA_H1_Text4" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>But it’s still a piece of software essentially asking you for proof of your claimed identity, and then based on that making decisions on what you can or can’t do with the files. Anyone with administrator access can always bypass these rules, since that’s what being an administrator means! Also, anyone with back-channel access to the data, such as a database backup, can access the data without being an administrator by using software that does not honor any access control to read the file.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_EVA_H2_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Encryption  does not care about who you are.  Decryption just either works or does not work, depending on if the right cryptographic key is provided to the decryption software.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_EVA_H2_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>There is no software enforcing the security, the data is transformed with encryption into a form that reveals nothing about the real contents. To reverse the transformation, to decrypt it, the correct cryptographic key is required. If the wrong key is provided, the decryption software can only fail. There’s no bypassing by being an administrator or accessing the data via back-channels.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_EVA_H2_Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>This also means that contrary to access control, anyone who holds the correct key can decrypt the data. It does not matter who you are or claim to be. If you have the key, you can decrypt.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_EVA_H2_Text4" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>That’s why the decryption key must be kept secret. That’s also why the encrypted content is irretrievably lost, if the decryption key is lost.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_EVA_H2_Text5" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>AxCrypt is an encryption software. It encrypts files. It does not authenticate users in order to ‘allow’ contents to be viewed.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_EVA_H3_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>If AxCrypt works by encryption, why does AxCrypt 2 ask you to sign in?</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_EVA_H3_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>We decided to use “sign in” as the metaphor for normal usage, because what happens is very similar, and most of us are used to “signing in”. What really happens is that we don’t authenticate the identity as such (your e-mail), but we do ensure that the password provided is correct and associated with the e-mail. There’s a subtle difference. AxCrypt uses the verified password to encrypt and decrypt. Access control systems uses the authenticated identity to match against permissions.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_EVA_H3_Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>This also means, that if two users actually have the same password, they will be able to decrypt each others files. That’s another reason to chose a really long, good and strong password so that this risk is reduced to effective zero.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_EVA_H3_Text4" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>One of the reasons we verify the password at all for encryption is to reduce the risk of you mistyping the password when encrypting files, which unfortunately happens all too frequently with AxCrypt 1. Even with the requirement to type it twice.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_EVA_H3_Text5" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>This AxCrypt sign in metahpor thus provides us with real benefits, we only have to enter it once per session and new files will be guaranteed to be encrypted with the password we actually intended to use – and which is verified to be the one we used the last time, i.e. the correct one.</value>

  <data name="Blog_FOKM_H1_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Effective data security is built on the foundation of key management also known as KMS. It is the process of administering or managing cryptographic keys. A critical feature of any KMS is its capacity to handle keys systematically throughout its lifecycle: key generation, key import/export, key distribution, key usage, key update, key backup, key revocation, and key deletion. Data is encrypted and decrypted using encryption keys, therefore the loss or compromise of any encryption key renders the data protection. It also ensures the safe transmission of data across an internet connection and not just includes access control but also monitoring and logging of each key's access, use, and context.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_FOKM_H2_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Key management deals with numerous types of security risks beyond encryption, such as people and incorrect policies, cyber attacks and data theft on networks. It is one of the most difficult components of cryptography. It also entails developing a system policy, user training, interdepartmental collaboration, and effective coordination.&lt;br/&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_FOKM_H2_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>In large corporations all members have access to the company data, therefore security is a major concern. The solution is a multicast group key management system that securely distributes individual keys to each member. In this way, material encrypted with a single group member's key can only be accessed and read by that group member.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_FOKM_H2_Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Key Management also includes controls to guarantee that keys are only accessible to authorised personnel and systems, that they are only used for their intended purposes, and that all key activities are logged for audit and compliance purposes.</value>

    <value>Cybercriminals are constantly on the lookout for weak points to exploit. How can users have complete confidence that their data is safe, no matter where it is stored, especially in this increasingly connected world? Encryption is one of the most prevalent methods for safeguarding sensitive information. Encryption works by turning ordinary text to ciphertext, which consists of seemingly random characters. It can only be decrypted by those who hold the unique key.</value>

    <value>How AxCrypt Adds Value To Your Business</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HEIDS_H1_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Exploitation of an individual’s interest by a scammer in order to access restricted information. Phishing is by far the most entrenched form of data security breach in this sphere. Due to its nature, the victims of this form of data breach at times have no idea that they are leaving themselves open to exploitation. The way phishing works is that the entity with the intention to access unauthorized information lures the potential victim into thinking that they are engaging with a legitimate online entity; usually via email to access the desired information. The victim, unaware that they are being scammed, end up giving the desired information themselves. To the mind of the victim, they are only giving out desired information to a legitimate online platform. The end result is that the person ends up aiding in the data breach, albeit unknowingly, through accessing malicious links or email attachments.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HEIDS_H10_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Outsourcing or dealing with contractors whose perspective of data security might be different from that of the organization that is contacting outside vendors. Outsourcing has been known to contribute to cases of data breaches. When vendors have access to information that is deemed sensitive and they themselves do not appreciate its importance, which could lead to serious data leakages.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HEIDS_H2_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Mail misdelivery is another form of human error that impacts on data security. Misdelivery occurs when those entrusted with the delivery of sensitive information either intentionally or unknowingly end up delivering such information to unauthorized users. In this age of email mass marketing and other forms of massive data transfer, persons handling such transfers are mandated to guarantee the safety of data being sent. The use of encryption in such transfers helps minimize the accessibility of such information should it find its way to unintended recipients.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HEIDS_H3_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Unauthorized access to information outlets such as company devices. Those entrusted with such devices should treat them with the importance they deserve. It’s not uncommon to find employees with access to such devices allowing unrestricted access to their friends or family members. It’s during those interactions that information can be accessed without the person’s knowledge, leading to a serious breach in data security. The owners of such devices should be trained on the importance of the gadgets in their possession as they are literally the gatekeepers of such sensitive information.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HEIDS_H4_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Poor password usage can seriously undermine a person’s or corporate data. The accessibility to such information should be password protected. In fact, it’s no longer just about having a password. More is expected, the routine changing of these passwords guarantees that access to such information is restricted. Another way would be to avoid using obvious words for passwords. Individuals entrusted with password requesting devices should avoid sharing such passwords. Corporations should emphasise to their employees the importance of employing proper password management practices to avoid data security breaches.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HEIDS_H5_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Inadequate or in some cases absence of relevant training on people entrusted with such data. The frequent incorporation of information management systems to members of staff that handle sensitive information minimizes the risk of human error, as members can refer to their training on best practices employed in the handling of such information. The absence of such laid out guidelines and expectations would most definitely expose employees to violations in data security.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HEIDS_H6_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Little awareness of matters relating to data security. Security has to be emphasized to all members handling company data. Issues on software upgrade that bring about improved security measures are not a management issue alone. Best internet and data handling software should be put to use and the relevant persons educated on their importance and use. Things like data security upgrades should be at the forefront of staff members in conjunction with the relevant Information technology personnel. Data security should be a primary responsibility of all staff members; it’s the absence of such awareness that could lead to data being compromised.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HEIDS_H7_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Careless or outright incompetence when it comes to data handling. In the daily execution of one’s duties, set out procedures might be overlooked. The need to meet targets and deadlines will most often make people overlook procedures that they consider cumbersome. These shortcuts are sometimes the root course of known data breaches. It’s the responsibility of those charged with management to ensure laid out data handling procedures adhere to irrespective of the workload. In the rush to finish assignments employees who are not keen to details might be responsible for coursing data breaches.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HEIDS_H8_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Unrestricted data usage is yet another factor that results in data being compromised. The ease with which persons access any or all information should be a subject of scrutiny. By leaving an institution’s data access points manned and the need to apply multiple layers, authentication when accessing or requesting certain data that is considered sensitive is critical in limiting data leakages. The absence of such measures means that anybody with access can retrieve any information they so wish for their personal use. Restriction brings about accountability and traceability, especially when dealing with sensitive information.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HEIDS_H9_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The human aspect associated with budget allocation in matters relating to data security is sometimes to blame for data breaches. With management always on the lookout for cost-cutting measures, the need to invest and come up with a sustained approach to a data breach scenario might not be appreciated. This is especially so when the said company has never experienced any data breaches. The failure to allocate funds and invest in data security measures leaves the company vulnerable to data attacks, more so when they are ill prepared when these attacks occur.</value>

    <value>It’s common sense that stronger encryption leads to more protected information. Most of the time, 128-bit encryption is already enough to secure your files. It keeps away brute force attacks and renders most hackers ineffective when trying to access your information.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HFMICTETP_H1_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>However, some providers offer 256-bit encryption for file encryption, which is the most premium protection available. 256-bit encryption is being utilized to protect confidential and top secret data across the world, and as technology continuously evolves, most sectors would need to consider shifting to stronger encryption methods.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HFMICTETP_H1_Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Enterprises need to at least acquire an enterprise encryption software with 128-bit encryption so that their documents will not be vulnerable to cyberattacks, but as these threats become more complex and as hackers continue to look for loopholes to breach data, establishments can afford to gain extra peace of mind and security with 256-bit encryption.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HFMICTETP_H3_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Smartphones and other mobile devices have been gaining ground during the most recent years. &lt;a href='https://www.bankmycell.com/blog/how-many-phones-are-in-the-world'&gt;Latest data&lt;/a&gt; tallies 3.5 billion smartphone users and 4.8 billion smart and feature phone users across the globe, and while offices remain a preferable environment for employees, some staff members are more comfortable with working on tablets or mobile phones as they live on the go. As such, businesses have gone beyond only using the computer for file management.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HFMICTETP_H3_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>However, a lot of them still struggle in searching for a solution for safekeeping the data stored and gone across these devices. Threats continue to lurk despite the convenience and with that, potential risks and losses for any organization.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HFMICTETP_H3_Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Luckily, enterprise encryption software is now readily available in the market, providing organizations guaranteed safety with all their files across any device.</value>
  </data>

  <data name="Blog_HFMICTETP_H4_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>When discussing file encryption, most companies are led to believe that protection needs to be at its best during distribution and delivery. However, these are just two points in the entire file journey, and any company that wishes to keep up with the times must look at the bigger picture and consider all the stops when it comes to file management. That’s &lt;a href='https://www.axcrypt.net/support/blog/what-encryption-really-is-about/'&gt;what encryption really is about&lt;/a&gt;.</value>

  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HFMICTETP_H5_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>As data moves from cloud-based platforms and storage to users with access to that information, a strong encryption code is deployed to protect the files from external users that can intercept information as they travel to and from the cloud or when documents are being saved to your cloud’s storage.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HFMICTETP_H5_Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>As an added convenience to their robust features of encryption, some providers oversee encryption for their clients.

    <value>&lt;b&gt;ZV:&lt;/b&gt; File encryption! Our vision: security, reliability, and simplicity. Everything we make is done with these as the highest priority. Our file encryption software is available for free, and we add another layer of features in AxCrypt Premium and Business. This includes a password manager and key sharing.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HOA_H2_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;b&gt;ZV:&lt;/b&gt; We have many private individuals that use AxCrypt. As for businesses, we see mainly financial services, governmental institutions (administration, education, health care), and IT companies.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HOA_H3_Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;b&gt;ZV:&lt;/b&gt; Ransomware has seen a huge increase over the last few years, probably in part due to companies getting better at securing their data. The problem is that in ransomware attacks, keeping your data encrypted is not enough. It’s more important than ever to make sure you have recent backups of all of your important data, and that these backups are stored in separate locations, so an attacker can never get to both your live data and backups.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HOA_H4_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;b&gt;ZV:&lt;/b&gt; More and more of our society is connected, but it will be even more so in the future. The Internet of Things (IoT) has been a topic for the last decade, but it has yet to really make an impact. When this impact comes, it means every household will have numerous connected devices, some of which you might not even realize is connected and hence very poorly protected. More poorly protected devices mean more attack vectors which can be used for a whole multitude of malicious intents.</value>

    <value>Phone encryption is not a new concept in the mobile business, and it has become an unavoidable element of the design process for all smartphone makers. Mobile encryption can accomplish everything for you, from preventing your data from being stolen to keeping your personal information safe. Now that you understand the need for encrypted data, encrypt all of your mobile devices to protect your data from unauthorized access.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HPDYMP_H1_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Mobile phones have become an integral part of our daily lives. They have become the main target for hackers as a result of the global pandemic and the rise in remote work. There are many undiscovered risks out there attempting to get private data on your mobile device. When it comes to the information stored on a phone, many people underestimate its true worth. Your phone contains all of your personal information while acting as a data bank and a social media hub.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HPDYMP_H1_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Mobile security is a precautionary measure used to safeguard data against a variety of threats aimed to invade privacy and steal any other information kept on the phone. These data assaults are aimed towards stealing personal information, such as bank account numbers, login credentials, and other information. Make no mistake about a hacker's abilities. Hackers have a simple way of manipulating or stealing your phone's data. Hacking isn't necessarily limited to collecting usernames and passwords or sending out phishing emails.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HPDYMP_H2_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Identity theft, fraud, and the theft of financial resources from employees and consumers are all possible outcomes of unprotected data. Every year, 4.3% of company-issued smartphones are lost or stolen. On average, roughly 10,573 mobile breaches occur per day. Large, small, public, and private enterprises all experience data breaches. In fact, hackers are increasingly targeting small and mid-sized organizations since their networks are less secure.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HPDYMP_H2_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Hackers now have the ability to listen in on chats and hack into any data on your phone. Without your permission, your social media accounts, bank accounts, sensitive images, private text messages, and more could be accessed.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HPDYMP_H3_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Perhaps the simplest approach to keep your phone safe from unauthorized is using a passcode. But that isn't enough; cracking someone's passcode is no longer rocket science. Mobile data encryption is one of the best ways to protect your sensitive information on a phone, even while you are on the go. AxCrypt Mobile encryption is beyond a regular lock screen password. It is a one-stop for safeguarding all of your personal information and data on your mobile phones from prying eyes.

    <value>A cyberattack occurs when cybercriminals try to gain illegal access to electronic data stored on a computer or a network. The intent might be to inflict reputational damage or harm to a business or person, or theft of valuable data. Cyberattacks can target individuals, groups, organizations, or governments.</value>

  <data name="Blog_HPYBFC_H4_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>A data breach is a type of security incident. It occurs when information is accessed without authorization. The information accessed could include personal information such as Social Security numbers, passwords, and financial account numbers.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HPYBFC_H5_SH1_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Using strong passwords is one way to protect your information online, so avoid using the same, easy-to-crack passwords, no matter how much you love your pet. Adopt symbols, numbers and different figures so no one can guess it by knowing personal information about you. You can also use the &lt;a href='/information/password-generator' style='font-weight: 800;'&gt;AxCrypt Password Generator&lt;/a&gt; that produces strong passwords that are not nonsensical and actually possible to remember and type. You'll get three suggestions of decreasing strength and complexity.</value>

  <data name="Blog_HPYBFC_H5_SH2_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Encryption is a way to make communications that are intended to be private actually remain private. It will help protect customers' data and anticipate threats. By encrypting your data and making it unreadable you guarantee security and productivity. Even if intercepted, the message will be unreadable for any actor that doesn't possess the right key to decrypt it.</value>

  <data name="Blog_HPYBFC_H5_SH3_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Backing up your business's data and website will help you recover any information you lose if you experience a cyber incident or have computer issues. It's essential that you backup your most important data and information regularly.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_HPYBFC_H5_SH3_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Ensure you use multi-factor authentication (MFA). MFA is a verification security process that requires you to provide two or more proofs of your identity before you can access your account. For example, a system will require a password and a code sent to your mobile device before access is granted. Multi-factor authentication adds an additional layer of security to make it harder for attackers to gain access to your device or online accounts.</value>

  <data name="Blog_HPYBFC_H5_SH4_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Train every new employee to protect valuable data and have them sign your information policy. Use newsletters and/or ongoing training to reinforce your culture of cybersecurity. Raise cyber security awareness among the staff and teach them how to access data in the best, secure way on every device. They should know the risks of using data with an unsecure network. That can save the company from a massive loss in the years to come. Your business is only as secure as its weakest link.</value>

  <data name="Blog_ICSHRS_H1_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>As we adjust to a new work environment that no one may ever have envisioned, the pandemic has disturbed organizations and led human resources managers to rethink how to perform their duties. HR professionals are worried not just about their employees' health and well-being during the epidemic, but also about processing paperwork in a secure manner and providing comfort to the millions of people who have been laid off or working remotely.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_ICSHRS_H2_SH1_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>An organization's risk exposure can be determined by completing a risk assessment regularly. Regular evaluations can assist identify which employee habits are most likely to expose a company to data breaches or other hazards. A risk assessment by HR, for example, can assist a business in identifying an insecure workstation. It can also show whether staff has misplaced their identification cards. Employee errors might provide thieves with valuable information or unrestricted access to a company's network.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_ICSHRS_H2_SH2_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>HR needs to keep rules well-documented and ensure that every recruit is aware of them. This comprises protocols for reporting threats, effectively responding to them, and so on, to protect a company and its data.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_ICSHRS_H2_SH3_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>An attacker can impersonate an employee to obtain access to a system from within, therefore investing time and resources in background checks is a critical security strategy that can help a company protect its systems. Background checks can be costly, and a company may not have the means to conduct them properly. In this instance, it's best to outsource these services to professional security agencies that can run thorough background checks that reveal information that the HR department doesn't have access to.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_ICSHRS_H2_SH4_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The human resources department can assist a company in setting up and implementing access restrictions. Even before an employee is hired or onboarded, HR can establish the data that they will need. They must also ensure that at the end of their contract, the employee does not have access to this information.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_ICSHRS_H2_SH5_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>If a breach occurs, the IT department is not solely responsible for resolving the issue. It's also a human resources concern, especially if there are employees involved. HR is accountable for its employees' conduct. This leaves organizations open to cybercrime.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_ICSHRS_H2_SH6_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Security has become too important to ignore in the face of the growing menace of cybercrime. Furthermore, it has made internet security a role for the entire firm, rather than just for information technology security specialists. AxCrypt offers 256-bit encryption and a slew of other capabilities that allow teammates to collaborate while maintaining cyber security. It can assist HR personnel in making a good contribution to a company's cybersecurity.</value>

    <value>HRs are in charge of a lot of confidential business information, including employee personal information, payment details, and other information that, if disclosed, might do significant harm. As a result, HR professionals are in a great position to protect against cyber threats.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_ICSHRS_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>In this digital age, cybersecurity is becoming a major problem for businesses. When information breaches, data hacks, and identity thefts occur, many people believe that HR professionals, for example, have nothing to worry about.

    <value>Importance of cyber security in the human resources sector</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_ITESBETFC_Conclusion_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Cybercrime is on the rise, and educational institutions are particularly vulnerable. Unfortunately, many educational institutions do not use encryption technology, despite the fact that it is a fundamental security measure mandated by rules and policies.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_ITESBETFC_H1_SH1_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>In the face of known risks, educational institutions can be reasonably protected with encryption. Encryption is now a requirement in the commercial world. Encryption is used to protect data in almost every business that deals with personal or sensitive information. Because student information contains everything that attackers need to steal a person's identity and/or engage in other illicit actions, educational organizations, and suppliers that do business with them are undoubtedly the most targeted for malicious data breaches. Cybercriminals have practically unrestricted access to stolen education data, allowing them to profit, cause harm, and ruin lives.&lt;/a&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_ITESBETFC_H1_SH1_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Encryption protects data in the following ways:</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_ITESBETFC_H1_SH1_Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;li&gt;Only approved receivers have access to view the messages from the moment they are created, throughout their entire lifecycle, regardless of where they go or with whom they are shared.&lt;/li&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_ITESBETFC_H1_SH1_Text4" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;li&gt;Even if data falls into the wrong hands due to a breach of user error&lt;/li&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_ITESBETFC_H1_SH1_Text5" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;li&gt;On top of the platforms they already use, such as G Suite for Education or Microsoft Outlook, data encryption from a trustworthy source adds an extra layer of data protection, ensuring ease of use, recognizable workflows, and high user uptake.&lt;/li&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_ITESBETFC_H1_SubHeading1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;strong&gt;How to protect data?&lt;/strong&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_ITESBETFC_H1_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Huge Amounts of Sensitive Data are Protected in Schools. Multiple types of personally identifiable data, such as social security numbers, credit card numbers, driver's license numbers, passport numbers, addresses, phone numbers, bank/debit account numbers, medical information, and other sensitive data, are routinely handled by educational institutions of all sizes. These organizations also have access to confidential government and/or business intelligence data about trade, scientific, or military secrets because of their research focus.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_ITESBETFC_H1_Text2" xml:space="preserve">

    <value>Why are hackers targeting educational institutes?</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_ITESBETFC_Summary" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Educational institutes have become more exposed to cyberattacks as a result of the greater use of technology for teaching and learning.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_ITESBETFC_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Educational institutes have become more exposed to cyberattacks as a result of the greater use of technology for teaching and learning. According to reports( Instead of adding a link to a resource, mention the name here. Eg according to the Oxford study type), the education sector accounted for 62% of the approximately 5.8 million malware cases reported.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_ITESBETFC_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Therefore, today's schools require a strong and dependable system to ensure the privacy and security of their students' data, as well as their school's compliance with all regulations, in the face of rapidly expanding stores of student data, a rise in data breach threats, and the growing amount of data privacy legislation. These requirements can be met via data encryption.</value>

    <value>When you use AxCrypt 2, first you have to “sign in” – after the first time, that’s just entering your password. Since AxCrypt is a password based file encryption application, that makes sense.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_LYCWAR_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>When you use AxCrypt 2, first you have to “sign in” – after the first time, that’s just entering your password. Since AxCrypt is a password based file encryption application, that makes sense. Even if the password is really the only thing that’s required to decrypt a file, we decided to use the “sign in” metaphor for a number of reasons, among others to make it harder to make a fatal mistake that sometimes happened with AxCrypt 1, which was to mistype the password twice when encrypting a new file. This would sometimes lead to data loss, and that’s bad.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_LYCWAR_Text10" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>It should also be noted that AxCrypt is not really 100% about local device security, there are too many things outside our control for that. For local device security, we recommend using hard disk or device encryption such as BitLocker, FileVault or mobile device encryption as an excellent complement to AxCrypt.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_LYCWAR_Text11" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>To summarize, we do not think think that the “&lt;em&gt;what if someone walks up to my computer&lt;/em&gt;” argument against having AxCrypt stay signed in is valid.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_LYCWAR_Text12" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;strong&gt;We think you should activate your screen saver if you walk away from a device&amp;nbsp;with information on it confidential enough to warrant encryption in the first place.&lt;/strong&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_LYCWAR_Text13" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Happy AxCrypting!</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_LYCWAR_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Once you are signed in to AxCrypt 2, it’ll stay signed in until you sign out, or the screen saver goes active, or the device goes to sleep, or you sign out of your user account, or you power down the device.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_LYCWAR_Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>This is done by careful design to make AxCrypt 2 as convenient as possible to use, i.e. reduce the number of times the password must be entered. This, we believe, will make it used more and thus protect more files. If it’s inconvenient, you won’t use it as much.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_LYCWAR_Text4" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>However, now and then we get feedback from users stating “&lt;em&gt;But what if someone walks up to my computer? Then all my files are unprotected.&lt;/em&gt;“.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_LYCWAR_Text5" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Yes, that’s true. But it almost makes no difference if AxCrypt is signed in or not, if you leave your device unprotected so anyone can walk up to it and access it with your user sign in permissions.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_LYCWAR_Text6" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>It’s that simple. Security is about a chain of measures, and it’s the weakest one that controls the strength of the system.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_LYCWAR_Text7" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;em&gt;If you let anyone walk up to your device and it’s signed in with your user, you should consider that computer compromised&lt;/em&gt; and re-install from original media.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_LYCWAR_Text8" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>AxCrypt has always been an opinionated application. This means we have opinions about how it should be used, opinions we base on the fact that encryption is all we do. We eat, drink, think and dream about encryption 24 hours a day. We think our opinions are fairly valid. Of course we’re not infallible, but we’re seldom far off the mark.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_LYCWAR_Text9" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>AxCrypt has always been about real, definable, security. It’s not about making you feel secure. It is about making you actually secure within well defined bounds and limitations. Making you &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; more secure by having you pointlessly re-enter a password a zillion times is not our thing.</value>

    <value>Mobile security is an important component of a cybersecurity strategy in today's world. The widespread adoption of Bring-Your-Own-Device (BYOD) policies was a direct result of the transition to remote work. Companies may have increased productivity and employee retention by enabling employees to work from personal devices, but they also lost crucial security visibility and the capacity to respond to infections that jeopardize corporate systems and solutions.</value>

    <value>In many circumstances, storing encrypted data in the cloud is safer than keeping it on-premises, where insiders may have greater access. If you want to keep encrypted data safe in the cloud, be sure you have custody of the encryption keys, not your cloud provider. Find another cloud service if your current one demands you to hand over your keys. AxCrypt is designed to simplify advanced encryption on multiple cloud storage services such as Google Drive, Dropbox, etc. &lt;a href='https://axcrypt.net/blog/what-is-cloud-computing-and-its-common-threats'&gt;Read more about the AxCrypt cloud encryption feature here&lt;/a&gt;.</value>

    <value>It is one of the most widespread Encryption misconceptions. This could be because we only hear about hackers targeting big businesses, which is also untrue. In fact, Small firms and individuals are targeted more than big businesses. According to a survey, small firms target 43% of cyber-attacks. This is primarily due to their systems' lack of fortification–exactly what cybercriminals seek. You still need encryption, no matter how small your company is.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_MDSCBF_H2_SH5_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Many individuals and businesses avoid encryption because they believe it will be too costly. Again, this is not true. Some of the encryption software and applications may appear to be expensive at first. However, you must consider the future. It's more of an investment than anything else. Consider the financial impact of a data breach. Think about the lawsuits and your reputation; it might jeopardize your company's future. That is something you do not want to happen.</value>

  <data name="Blog_MDSCBF_H2_SH6_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>There's no excuse not to encrypt now that your major myths have been debunked. AxCrypt is a user-friendly software for encrypting data on mobile devices, computers, and laptops while the data is in use, rest, or in transit. AxCrypt also has various features to meet a wide range of data security requirements.</value>

    <value>By making data unreadable by others, mobile encryption ensures that customers' data remains private and safe. Data that has been encrypted cannot be retrieved, making it more difficult in the current situation. The data on the phone can still be recovered even if the owner deletes everything on it to resell it. The only way to decrypt data once after encryption is to factory reset the phone. Furthermore, the expansion of digital payments, enhanced applications, and information interchange via mobile devices generate a large amount of data that must protect from cyber threats. As a result, data can secure from these crimes by using mobile encryption software, propelling the market forward.</value>

    <value>Master key is a feature which enables business administrators to recover files of the business members. This eliminates the risk of losing access to critical files. As long as the business has one or a couple administrators who make sure to keep track of their credentials, no documents will ever be lost at AxCrypt due to employees leaving or forgetting their passwords.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_MK_H1_SH2_text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Master Key is highly secure, it can be viewed as an automatic sharing of files with the administrators of the business. Here administrators will automatically be able to recover files which have Master key applied. This feature is tried and tested, and is used by many of users already. And yes, it is important for the business administrators to be extra careful to choose a good password. The choice of password is extremely important, the business administrator should make sure that the password is strong enough to secure the files and documents. Here's the link to our &lt;a href='https://www.axcrypt.net/support/password-generator'&gt;password generator&lt;/a&gt; which can help picking passwords that are both strong and easy to remember.</value>

    <value>When a file is encrypted with AxCrypt, a very random 128- or 256-bit key as appropriate is generated by AxCrypt. This key, which is never really seen by anyone, is used to encrypt the file with AES-128 or AES-256. This key we call the master encryption key.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_PRAA_H1_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The master encryption key in turn, is encrypted with your password, and stored along with the encrypted file data in the resulting AxCrypt-encrypted file.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_PRAA_H1_Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>This design, which is standard good practice for encryption, also means we can do exciting things by encrypting that same master encryption key in other ways. Which we do, but that’s not the topic for this article.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_PRAA_H1_Text4" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Thus, as long as you know the password used to originally encrypt a file you can decrypt it with AxCrypt.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_PRAA_H1_Text5" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>We also by default use the same password for the online account where we store your subscription status, your online password manager data if used, and your AxCrypt ID which is used primarily for the key sharing feature.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_PRAA_H2_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>If you use the password change feature of the web or the AxCrypt app, what happens is that we change the password for data that we keep online, which includes re-encryption anything you may keep in the password manager, and also your AxCrypt ID which is stored as an AxCrypt encrypted piece of data in our system.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_PRAA_H2_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>To change your password, you must know the old one, since otherwise we cannot decrypt the data we store before encrypting it again with your new password.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_PRAA_H2_Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>We do not actually change the password for every encrypted file, since to do that we’d need access to every single one and decrypt them with the old password, and re-encrypt with the new.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_PRAA_H2_Text4" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>But since we change the password for your AxCrypt ID, you will actually be able to open old files with the new password. More on how that actually works in a different article.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_PRAA_H3_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>If forget your password, you will lose access to everything ever encrypted with that password. On the server, this means your AxCrypt ID and your data in the online password manager.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_PRAA_H3_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>But, you can still regain access to the web account, by requesting a password reset. This does not require you to know the old password, but it does require you to once again verify that you have access to the email account in question. This we do by sending an activation link once again to that email, and after clicking on that you can set a new password.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_PRAA_H3_Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Remember, a password reset only gets you back so you can sign in and continue using the app and the web site, it does not allow you to regain access to files encrypted with the old password.</value>

If your device is lost or stolen, it will be harder for someone else to acquire its contents. Whether you are sending emails, sharing photos, or just browsing the web, encryption helps to keep your information safe from prying eyes. Encryption uses password protection to make data unreadable by third parties and prevent snoopers from accessing your information. This keeps hackers out while still allowing you control over who has access to your data.</value>

    <value>A crucial component of any company's security policies is password management. Users can secure their login information against unauthorised access, which can defend the user and the business against dangers. AxCrypt offers its distinctive password management feature, which is user-friendly and dependable, to both individuals and commercial enterprises. Your company could be more organised to fend off cyberattacks with the help of AxCrypt. Look nowhere else! While you relax and take in your tranquillity, let AxCrypt take care of all your cybersecurity needs.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_ROCP_H1_SH1_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Make sure that only authorised people have access to critical information to protect your data. Verifying and maintaining the integrity of your data, as well as knowing exactly what data you have in your custody, is also very important.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_ROCP_H1_SH2_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Avoid selecting the “remember my password” option because hackers may pose a threat by altering or bypassing the browser's security settings to gain access to passwords on newer web browsers. Additionally, it's preferable to refrain from keeping passwords in public or digital documents.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_ROCP_H1_SH3_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Passwords must contain upper- and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters (such as @,£, percent, and &amp;), and they must be at least ten characters long. Businesses should establish a password security policy and update it frequently. Additionally, each employee in the organisation needs to have their own password.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_ROCP_H1_SH4_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>An additional layer of security is added to the password procedure by using a multi-factor authentication system. Because of this, the solution can be used to strengthen your company's security posture and guard against password breaches. In fact, putting this system in place by itself can assist you to eliminate 99% of account breaches.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_ROCP_H1_SH5_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>A password manager is a safe, digital instrument that centrally stores your internet login information and passwords and is protected by a single, strong master password. Additionally, password managers may create strong, one-of-a-kind passwords for you. By assisting you in creating a password that is specific to each of your accounts, this application improves data security. As a result, if one of your accounts is compromised, the password that was used to access it cannot be used to access any other accounts.</value>

    <value>Help desks waste time on password retrieval, and time is money. Even if they tried to memorise passwords, help desk staff members frequently forget them due to frequent changes and the volume of accounts they must manage. Password management using a browser is not secure, and saving them in a different spreadsheet is even less secure since they are typically not synced to the cloud. Password changes are recorded and do not save a company with a bad reputation from the &lt;a href='https://itsblossom.com/blog/2019/10/21/employees-revenge-on-bosses/'&gt; vengeance of an angry employee &lt;/a&gt; who has left the firm.</value>

    <value>It can be difficult to keep track of all the passwords and credentials you acquire as a business owner, both individually and professionally. Protecting the passwords of both your business and your clients makes it even harder. On the one hand, employing the same password across all of your logins is risky and may result in the hacking of your business accounts. On the other hand, because certain employees or consultants are temporary, you may not always be able to regulate who has access to what credentials within the organisation.</value>

    <value>Some Common Myths About Encryption</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_SD_H1_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Do you use Netflix? If you have a Netflix account, you have probably heard of the recently released documentary “The Social Dilemma”, which touches on the significant advantages of social media. Google, Apple, YouTube, Facebook and all these tools have made wonderful things a reality. Reuniting family members, enabling effective communication and enhancing our connectivity are only ones of the meaningful systemic changes that this innovating industry has brought. Nevertheless this increasing polarization does not only have advantages. As highlighted in the documentary people are sometimes a little too naïve about the flip side of that coin.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_SD_H2_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Everything you do online is being tracked, measured and analysed. You might feel it is now time for you to take your personal security more seriously. It is time to understand the dangers of having your personal information leaked to those who have an ulterior motive. Hackers can easily take advantage of vulnerable breach to your computer and get access to your emails, documents or files to later use it for malicious purposes. To avoid having a breach in your personal data and have a complete online security and peace of mind; encrypt your files with AxCrypt to keep your private information safe!</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_SD_H3_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>By converting your private information into a secret code that hides the information's true meaning, you make it almost impossible for an intruder to decrypt it to plaintext. When an encrypted message is intercepted by an unauthorized entity, the inflator has to guess the variables that were used to encrypt the message. The time and difficulty of guessing this information is what makes encryption such a valuable security tool; take the data, run it through an encryption algorithm, and it's unreadable to anyone who doesn't possess the right key to reverse the process. Used by the military and governments, encryption is a longstanding way of protecting data in transit and data at rest as well as restricting access when access controls aren't sufficient. Few technologies come as close as encryption to nearly unbreakable data security. The use of encryption is almost as old as the art of communication itself and it provides confidentiality, authentication and integrity.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_SD_H4_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>File encryption plays a major role in enterprises regardless of industry or size and with the complexity of cyber attacks being on continual growth, companies might consider gaining extra peace of mind and security with an encryption software. Files would not only be organized and easily accessible but also safe from threats that lurk in the virtual realm.</value>

    <value>Updates for smartphones must be installed frequently. Updates are primarily intended to correct vulnerabilities as they are found because hackers are constantly discovering new ones. Your phone isn't protected from this issue if it isn't being updated. &lt;a href='https://www.makeuseof.com/safe-use-phone-no-longer-gets-updates/'&gt; People often use outdated phones voluntarily,&lt;/a&gt;however, it may also occur if the maker of the phone is no longer offering security upgrades. Whatever the reason, an outdated phone offers a security risk and shouldn't be used for anything crucial.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_SSING_H1_SH2_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>If security is important to you, you probably only download apps directly from the Apple App Store or Google Play Store. The majority of fraudulent apps are protected from you by this, yet even these platforms have flaws. Because these platforms are so popular, malicious apps occasionally get approved, and they are frequently heavily used before being taken down. Although it is tough to prevent this issue, you can safeguard your phone by only downloading reputable apps and removing anything you don't require.</value>

  <data name="Blog_SSING_H1_SH3_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>A phishing page is a website that has the appearance of being trustworthy but is actually intended to steal personal data. Usually, when you attempt to get into one of your accounts, your password is taken.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_SSING_H1_SH3_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Smartphones are made to guard against malware, yet they provide very little defense against phishing. Even though your phone is safe, using it could still lead to a hack, so be aware of this. Always carefully examine the URL before entering personal information to avoid scam pages.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_SSING_H1_SH4_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Complete control over what apps are able to perform is provided by permissions. You can install malicious software and it won't be able to do anything, provided permissions are appropriately constrained. Regrettably, permissions aren't always properly utilized. Installing an app entails essentially giving it access to all of your data if you don't limit what it can access. Even with trusted apps, you should allow the fewest permissions possible to avoid this issue.</value>

    <value>Nobody can access a smartphone that has been properly locked. However, there are numerous other techniques to lock a smartphone, and the efficiency varies.

    <value>Some users instinctively react negatively to the AxCrypt Premium subscription model. Not against the general principle of paying for Premium, but the yearly recurring fee as opposed to a ‘perpetual’ license.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_SVL_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Subscription vs. License</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_SVL_Text10" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>If you purchased a software at EUR 79, you’re stuck with that cost even if you change your mind after 6 or 12 months. You won’t get a refund for half the price because you’d like to stop using the software license.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_SVL_Text11" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>We’ve deliberately priced the yearly subscription at a level so 2-3 years is about at the same level as the typical corresponding software license. Yes, there are cheaper licensed software to be found. There are also plenty of more expensive options around.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_SVL_Text12" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Most software licenses are restricted to one or set number of installations. The AxCrypt subscription is personal but valid on any number of devices.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_SVL_Text13" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>It’s more relevant, because AxCrypt is not just a piece of software, it’s a hybrid cloud application. It’s a shared encryption platform which provides a server infrastructure for this purpose, as well as a password manager which also uses server resources. With Premium you also get access to support, which require staffing and other resources. In other words, we do have running costs even after delivering the software to you. So we think it’s simply more relevant that you subscribe to our services, just like you do for other cloud services.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_SVL_Text14" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>That it’s more predictable for us might not seem important to you as a user, but in fact it means that we can plan better for continued development of the platform.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_SVL_Text15" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>There are advantages for the license model as well, but right now we really feel that it’s better for both you and us!</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_SVL_Text16" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Finally, if you do stop subscribing, AxCrypt Free is still a very useful software and you’ll never get locked out of your data if you let your subscription expire so there is no negative locking in. Of course we’d like to think that we deliver so much value that you’ll want to stay because you think the cost is a bargain!</value>

  </data>
  <data name="Blog_SVL_Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I understand that, but I’d like to discuss why we’re doing it this way. In the end we’re of course always open to change, so comments are welcome. Do use our &lt;a href='http://www.axcrypt.net/forums/forum/community/'&gt;forums&lt;/a&gt; for that, and refer to this blog post so we know your starting point.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_SVL_Text4" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>There are several reasons why we prefer an annual subscription over a ‘perpetual’ license, but here’s the summary:</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_SVL_Text5" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;ol style='list-style-position: inside;display: grid;gap: 20%;'&gt;&lt;li&gt;It’s more honest, fair and predictable for you as a user.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It’s more relevant since much of the Premium service requires server and personnel resources continuously.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It’s more predictable for us.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_SVL_Text6" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>It’s more honest, fair and predictable because the typical software license is not at all perpetual. It’s usually valid for either the exact version you purchased, or for updates until an arbitrary point in time where a new ‘major’ release is published by the manufacturer. This is typically every 12-18 months. The old release will not get security updates, nor be made compatible with new operating systems, so in the end you’re anyway forced to accept the ‘upgrade offer’.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_SVL_Text7" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Many software companies also offer the worst of two worlds – a license, and a yearly support fee! With AxCrypt it’s simple and clean. A single yearly cost for it all.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_SVL_Text8" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>We first offer a 30 day Premium Trial, and then you can choose if you’d like to use it for another 6 or 12 months at a time and can stop at any time.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_SVL_Text9" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Our yearly subscription fee is currently EUR 30, while most simple encryption softwares license costs range between EUR 35 – 100. With the upgrades being added on top of that. It’s also fair and predictable because you know exactly what the cost is, and that there is a cost. With licensed software you might suddenly be forced to upgrade because your environment changed, perhaps your old computer broke.</value>

    <value>With all the above factors being put into consideration, &lt;a href='https://techiespad.com/'&gt;Techiespad team&lt;/a&gt; suggests that it is important you consider using encryption software that helps protect your data. With this kind of software, your data is heavily encrypted; a sure way to ensure that third parties wouldn’t access it without explicit authorization. The password management is also simple, plus you can make sure that your data is safe in cloud platforms such as Dropbox and Google Drive.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_Technical_Document" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>All of the above is simplified version of the process. Many additional details are actually included to ensure security, and to handle various synchronization scenarios, password reset events etc. For full details read the &lt;a href='https://www.axcrypt.net/information/technical/'&gt;technical documentation&lt;/a&gt;.</value>

  <data name="Blog_TIEDTC_Conclusion_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Every piece of information, no matter how little, must be protected against hackers in order to lower the rising rate of internet crime and the likelihood that businesses will be compromised.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_TIEDTC_H1_SH1_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Employee information must be protected given the period we are living in, which follows the impact of a global pandemic that has pushed many organisations to adjust to a new type of working environment. Every business, unless it is a sole proprietorship, has employees, and with that comes a lot of sensitive data that needs to be protected. Personal and financial information, timesheets and payment for employees, contracts, and sick notes are just a few examples of sensitive data. Protecting such information from unauthorised parties should be every company's top priority, especially when it is shared with external users. Information like this could be beneficial to hackers. Internally securing this data from public scrutiny is just as crucial Organisations run a significant risk of exposure, particularly through their personnel.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_TIEDTC_H1_SH2_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Every firm will have, in one way or another, information on customers, supplier contracts in detail, and documents about bids and tenders, to name a few commercial data kinds. Regulations governing the protection of customer information are applicable to all industries, but the banking and healthcare sectors are particularly sensitive to them. The relevance of this kind of information is frequently undermined and neglected. Every time information is shared, as well as when it is sent to and from internal systems, it must be encrypted because doing so could seriously endanger a corporation. When sharing such data, businesses must exercise caution because sensitive information about their customers or suppliers could be disclosed to unauthorised parties or even rival companies.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_TIEDTC_H1_SH3_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The concept of securing corporate legal information is increasing quickly and is quite sensitive due to the data it contains. The volume of data that must be encrypted to be considered legally relevant might be significant and vary greatly. It would cover things like firm policies and procedures, correspondence with attorneys, assets, minutes of meetings, agreements with suppliers or vendors, owner agreements, independent contract agreements, and more. In addition to the necessity of keeping the company's legal matters safely in its coffers, this move will increase customer and staff confidence in the organisation. End-to-end encryption is also a great idea when dealing with highly sensitive data like this. Data encryption offers consistent security for both data at rest and data in transit, which can provide individuals handling the information some peace of mind. Security regulations must be followed to protect legal data.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_TIEDTC_H1_SH4_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Most businesses must play their cards close to their chest. Sensitive information should always be encrypted to prevent hackers from accessing it. Financial information of a corporation may comprise its income and expense account, debtors and creditors account, assets, account numbers, payment history, and so forth. These kinds of data need to be protected from trespassers. Every time such data is exposed by cybercriminals, the company is at a great danger of being harmed and the clients and staff who trusted the organisation with their data are inconvenienced.</value>

    <value>Many businesses do not think their data has to be encrypted. They understand the value of this technology for protecting extremely sensitive and private information, but they do not think it applies to them because they do not own this information. One of the biggest developments in cybersecurity is expected to be confidential security. Private information, sensitive data, and the security of communication between relationships and businesses are all protected by it.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_TIEDTC_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>No matter how big or small, or what industry they serve, every organisation has significant data. They frequently discover they have considerably more of this information than they think they do, whether they are aware of it or not, especially after an audit. Understanding the usefulness of categorising data and its relevance is given little to no consideration.</value>

    <value>The Importance of Encrypting All Data In The Company</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_TPTWH EG_H1_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>you may have confidential conversations with employees, customers and investors, these often involve personal information, you run the risk of unintentional informal leaks, paperwork could be picked up unintentionally, phrases overheard and repeated for example. Legally your firm has to ensure the security of personal data and make sure it is only used for specific purposes. So here are some considerations:</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_TPTWHEG_H1_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>When working from home you are blurring the lines between work and home. Your usual work/home separation is not present, so you must consider risks that would normally be managed for you by your work environment. When you bring work and the tools of work home, you are allowing many people you don’t know very well, into your home. You are exposing your family to outside influences in an environment, where, they are used to being protected and safe. This poses subtle but real risks to, but also from you, your family and your employer.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_TPTWHEG_H1_Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Set expectations with those at home, when you can be interrupted, why privacy is important, but remember its your responsibility to protect everyone&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Make best efforts to separate work and home life, have confidential conversations with staff, et al in a separate space.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;No matter how frustrated you may become don’t fall into the trap of discussing confidential matters with those at home in lieu of the work colleague you would normally confide in.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; If possible have a separate, quiet space for working at home and be careful of working in the garden, fences have ears.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Make yourself aware of the personal data you are in contact with both from your home and your work, if you are aware of it, you can be mindful of it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_TPTWHEG_H2_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>When you bring your laptop and phone home, you bring cameras and microphones into your nest. Apps that use them like video conferencing are difficult enough to set up, use and remember to turn off without even considering hackers and bad actors. Not only do you bring your work eyes and ears home, but you also bring those at home to work. Do you have a home assistant speaker? How many tablets and phones are in your house?</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_TPTWHEG_H2_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>They all have microphones and cameras that could be active. Your daughter could be on a video call with friends, your home speaker could be activated and listening, you might have left that web meeting session open. You might even be running a video call with a group of customers from your kitchen table and expose pics of your kids, your home address, your kids’ school, when you are going on holiday, and that you will be protesting next Saturday ……. all from what happens to be stuck on the fridge door.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_TPTWHEG_H2_Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>It is essential that you take these risks seriously, information that should stay at home should stay just there and the same for work.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_TPTWHEG_H2_text4" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Be very aware of your surroundings and what you are broadcasting, if you have to work in a shared area, make sure you are not exposing pictures, letters or anything you would not want a stranger to see&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Consider the devices in your home, work away from family members who are making calls, work away from home assistants and make sure your conference sessions are closed when finished.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Make sure you think about the background, if you are so proud of your home office that you have to post it on Facebook, make sure nothing is in that image that exposes yours or someone else’s data&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Consider that your employer could be monitoring you, everything from microphones, what you access, keystrokes, your camera, how long your sessions are, screen grabs, web history can all be monitored and while this may be worrying from an evaluation perspective, when working from home it may capture personal data too.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_TPTWHEG_H3_text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Having promised this will not be a techno-blog, there are some considerations outside of your laptop that you just need to be aware of. When working in the office your security team will have set up policies, protected networks, filtered malicious emails, applied all kinds of clever security systems to reduce threats to the company.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_TPTWHEG_H3_text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>When you are working at home, you are nowhere near as protected. It’s also true that during the pandemic fraud, phishing and scams have increased by over 25% as bad actors take advantage of the disruption caused by Coronavirus. Your home router security is no match for the protection your office has, and, you are much more likely to be using your personal email and apps/games on the same laptop as your work.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_TPTWHEG_H3_text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;If your employer provides a VPN (a way of extending their security to your environment) use it religiously. We know it’s boring, but do read the security and governance policy that they provide you and abide by it&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Be extra vigilant when opening email of any kind. Think about whether it looks legitimate, there have been multiple instances of fraud, making out that due to the lockdown non-standard processes have been adopted and for example, funds need to be transferred to a different account, just this once&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;· If you are working on your home PC, be even more diligent with work data and work emails. In any case do not be tempted to store work data on personal cloud accounts and for that matter do not store personal data on work storage filing systems.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_TPTWHEG_H3_text4" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>In summary, privacy at home at its core is about consideration, if you are aware of how the risk changes when you move from office to home, and you are aware of the people whose data is at risk from your activities then you will naturally act more responsibly.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_TPTWHEG_H3_text5" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>We hope that you have found this guide useful, and hope that it helps protect personal data both during this pandemic, but also as we move into what our changed environment will be in the future.</value>

    <value>Encryption can come up as a very complicated subject. In short you transform plain text into a cypher code that no one can read without a special key to decrypt it. In that way intercepted messages or stolen information cannot be understood by a third party.</value>

    <value>One thing this horrid pandemic has changed for the better, is the ability of people to work at home and the recognition by employers that it’s not so scary to allow it. There are many arguments for and against hybrid working, but now many firms, having been forced to allow home working, are seeing that people do work conscientiously. They are also realising that costs can be cut on expensive office space and they have more motivated staff. Therefore, it is expected that we will see more people working at home and hybrid working in the future.</value>

    <value>Encryption is a fundamental component of security for all the tech tools and items we purchase on a daily basis. All of your files are encrypted by AxCrypt using one of the most secure encryption algorithms available: AES 256-bit encryption. This further demonstrates that our easy-to-use encryption technology is a dependable and straightforward method of protecting your data.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_TSTE_H1_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>AES is a symmetric block cipher with a 128-bit key length that encrypts a 128-bit message into a 128-bit cipher text. The key's bit size options are 128, 192, or 256 in ascending order. It is simpler to analyse than other devices that only have one bit in and one bit out.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_TSTE_H1_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Additionally, AES prefers to arrange things in a 4 by 4 grid for a 128 bit, which is equivalent to 16 bits in a 4x4 grid, as opposed to a long line of bits as most ciphers could do. AES replaces bytes, shifts rows, and mixes columns from a plain text by using a portion of its key.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_TSTE_H1_Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The first component is the substitution, the second is the permeation, and finally, we would add a round key at the conclusion of each round that is equivalent to the first round. But for a 128 bit encryption, it goes through 10 of these rounds, a 192 bit encryption, 12, and a 256 bit encryption, 14.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_TSTE_H2_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Most contemporary encryption algorithms, protocols, and technologies use AES 256-bit, which is among the &lt;a href='https://www.toptenreviews.com/secure-encryption-methods'&gt;safest and most secure encryption&lt;/a&gt; techniques after 128-bit and 192-bit encryption.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_TSTE_H2_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>A 256-bit encrypted message would take two-256 distinct combinations to be broken, making it practically hard for hackers or crackers and even the fastest computers to do so. However, it is also used for sensitive and critical information like financial, military, or government held data. Typically, 256-bit encryption is used for data in transit, data at rest, or a network or internet connection. You may feel secure knowing that your data is protected at the highest degree of encryption, AES 256.</value>

    <value>By fostering a culture of security and privacy, encryption has established itself in the modern digital sphere. The amount of data that different encryption techniques can process simultaneously and the type of key required to decrypt data vary. DES, AES, and RSA are the three main forms of encryption, but some are preferable to others. In 2001, the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) encryption algorithm replaced the Data Encryption Standard (DES) as the accepted global standard for encryption algorithms. This improved upon many of the drawbacks of the earlier method. The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) has so far met the goals set for it at the time of its creation. Officials in the government and other organisations utilise it because it is the recognized industry standard algorithm and the most secure sort of encryption.</value>

    <value>Additionally, it happened that users would set different passwords for different files, even if they were only for private use. This may *feel* safer, but in fact at best it adds no security and at worst it causes a situation with *less* security.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_UODPCH_Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The first scenario, sharing of encrypted files with other persons, is handled in AxCrypt by the Key Sharing feature. This will be discussed elsewhere, let it just be said here that it’s a much better way to achieve this benefit than different passwords.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_UODPCH_Text4" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The second, using different passwords for yourself, is a little counterintuitive perhaps but the truth is – there is no need, and no benefit. It might *feel* better, but it’s not the solution to any problem. One aspect is that having many passwords will most likely be more inconvenient and thus make you less prone to use encryption. That’s bad, you don’t have that added protection. Also, it increases the risk of forgetting one of them. That’s bad, you lose your data. If you have too many, you’ll have to use a password manager to keep track of them. That’s not necessarily bad, but it doesn’t improve anything either.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_UODPCH_Text5" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Using many passwords actually tend to decrease the practical security because it’s more inconvenient the barrier against use is higher, and also it’s simply too hard to keep track of many strong passwords. So the typical situation will be many weak passwords. Instead we’re saying that if you can handle one, strong password for all your files, we’ll make it convenient to use since you don’t have to enter it very often. This will in practical terms tend to increase security overall.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_UODPCH_Text6" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Security pundits have always looked for the holy grail of single sign on. We’re not there yet, and we won’t get there in our lifetime, but the main point is: Fewer passwords is better. That’s what we’re trying to achieve with AxCrypt 2.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_UODPCH_Text7" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>So, instead of using different passwords for different files, set a good and strong password and use that. With AxCrypt 2, you’ll only have to type it once per session, then you have immediate access to all your files. One password to rule them all…</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_UODPCH_Text8" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Regardless of whether you’re an old user of AxCrypt 1, or a new user, don’t fall into the multiple password trap. If you’re already in there, use AxCrypt and it’s auto conversion feature to quickly and easily get out of it!</value>

  <data name="Blog_WBFAHPI_H1_SH1_Following" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Most commonly there are 5 types of brute force attack</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WBFAHPI_H1_SH2_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>In this kind of brute force attack, attackers try multiple passwords to target a specific set of identities. Here, hackers try to guess manually or use trial and error method, with regards to the user's login credentials without using any software and hence, this method is time and resource intensive. Hackers try to generate all possible characters, numbers and special characters. This method is only effective for short powers, but terrible for slightly longer ones.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WBFAHPI_H1_SH3_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Password spraying is a form of reverse brute force attack where the attacker brute force logs into the application based on a list of usernames with default passwords. This attack is normally used in areas where the admin sets a default password for the new users. Normally, attackers try to guess the passwords. However, unlike a brute-force attack, which focuses on a single account, in this case, password injection attacks target multiple accounts at a time. Here the attackers gain access to a large number of accounts (usernames) with a few common passwords.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WBFAHPI_H1_SH4_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>From the name itself, it is obvious - it basically uses a large number of predefined popular phrases or terms normally found in a dictionary. In general, a good password list can improve the success rate of attackers, but here they often require multiple attempts against potential targets. The drawback of this kind of attack is that it is time-consuming and has a low probability compared to newer powerful attack methods.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WBFAHPI_H1_SH5_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>In this kind of attack, hackers combine a dictionary attack method with a simple brute force attack. Hackers normally would know the username, so they perform a dictionary attack and simple brute force methods to find the account login combination. This procedure involves choosing common words from a dictionary and replacing them with random numbers or characters. This combined approach is more effective.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WBFAHPI_H1_SH6_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>A credential “stuffing” attack involves stuffing passwords that have been hijacked or otherwise exposed by cybercriminals used in login fields of multiple websites. This attack is successful when users use the same username and password combination or reuse passwords for different social media accounts and profiles. Stolen credentials are sold and traded between cybercriminals on the dark web.</value>

  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WBFAHPI_H1_Type_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>A very common threat in this web era is brute force attack. A brute force attack in cyber security is an attempt to find a password by systematically trying all possible combinations of letters, numbers and symbols until you find the right working combination. Passwords aren't the only resource that can be brute-forced: links and directories, usernames and emails are other common targets too.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WBFAHPI_H2_SH2_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The success of a brute force attack is calculated in regard to the time taken to successfully crack a password. As the length of the password increases, the time required to crack also increases exponentially. It is estimated, 15 million key companies would need 9 minutes per second to crack a seven-digit password. A 13-digit password would last over 350,000 years.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WBFAHPI_H2_SH2_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;li&gt;It is always recommended not to use standard passwords, but it is better to use your own created passwords. The best thing is to create unique passwords that contain at least 15 numbers and several keywords. Long passwords consisting of random words/characters are more secure and easier for password cracking.&lt;/li&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WBFAHPI_H2_SH2_Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;li&gt;Lots of websites allow an infinite number of login attempts. It is recommended that the site administrator installs a plugin that limits the number of attempts to connect to the domain, by further preventing brute force attacks. Even a root user can allow brute force attacks on solid shell (SSH) connections, hence it is better to prevent users from accessing SSH by enabling “DenyUsers root” and “PermitRootLogin no”.&lt;/li&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WBFAHPI_H2_SH2_Text4" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;li&gt; It is recommended to have two-factor or multi-factor authentication, where the user must verify his authenticity before granting access to the system. If 2FA is activated, the user will be asked to enter a unique code assigned to a mobile phone number to verify its authenticity, before getting access to the network.&lt;/li&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WBFAHPI_H2_SH2_Text5" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;li&gt;The benefit of using CAPTCHA is that it protects against account takeovers, illegal purchases and other similar scenarios. CAPTCHAs prefer 100% security response.&lt;/li&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WBFAHPI_H2_Sh2_Text6" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;li&gt;A web application firewall (WAF) limits the number of requests a resource can make to a URL space in a given time period. In addition to brute-force attacks to steal session tokens, WAF also protects against denial-of-service (DOS) attacks that consume server resources and block vulnerability scanning tools that check the computer network for errors.&lt;/li&gt;</value>

  <data name="Blog_WBFAHPI_H2_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>An attacker can always find the password through a brute-force attack. Depending on the length and complexity of the password, there can be trillions of possible combinations and hence it might take years to crack the target passwords.</value>

    <value>Take the time to evaluate your data protection needs and investigate the proper and efficient encryption services to take advantage of the benefits of cloud encryption. Encryption in the cloud is a critical approach to information security, according to security experts. AxCrypt also has a variety of features to meet a wide range of data security requirements.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WCACT_H1_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Cloud computing uses the internet to provide a shared pool of data that can be accessed at any time. With the rise of remote work, the cloud provides greater flexibility and efficacy while also lowering expenses. Many individuals and corporations have already improved their operational efficiency while reducing IT expenditures by utilising cloud computing. The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the long-awaited widespread adoption of cloud systems, including multi cloud and hybrid installations. While cloud computing brings undeniable advantages, it is nevertheless vulnerable to both inside and outside threats.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WCACT_H1_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>79% of businesses have encountered at least one cloud data breach in the previous 18 months, and 43% have reported 10 or more breaches in that period.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WCACT_H2_SH1_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The most prevalent hazard to cloud computing is data breaches, which result in data leaks or loss. A data breach happens when a company is targeted by hackers who get illegal access to their cloud network. &lt;br/&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WCACT_H2_SH2_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>A denial of service (DoS) attack is one of the most dangerous risks to cloud services. Cybercriminals can overwhelm your system with a massive volume of web traffic that your servers can't handle. This implies that the servers will not buffer, and your employees and business as a whole will not be able to access anything on the cloud.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WCACT_H2_SH3_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>An attacker in a cloud system could be because of a client or employee with wide access, or it might be the result of ignorance or simple human mistake. Thus, administrators should establish high-level security designs with distinct degrees of access to cloud services to avoid malicious behaviour by an insider.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WCACT_H2_SH4_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Overly liberal access controls are another prominent cause of data breaches in cloud systems. Proper implementation of access controls within your cloud environment may considerably minimise risk exposure. To avoid any kind of credential leakage, organisations must implement a proper key management system. AxCrypt has a number of characteristics that make it a good key management solution.&lt;a href='https://www.axcrypt.net/blog/fundamentals-of-key-management'&gt;Read more about AxCrypt key management&lt;/a&gt;</value>

    <value>Considering cloud technology is still being actively developed, it has a number of flaws that hackers or hostile insiders may exploit. Therefore, it is critical to know where your system can be vulnerable and what you can do about it.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WCACT_H3_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Cloud users must implement security measures to safeguard their sensitive data from cyber-attacks. Encryption is one of the most effective data security methods, scrambling the information of any system, database, or file in such a way that it is difficult to understand by any third party without the key. Companies can guarantee that only authorised users have access to sensitive data by using encryption and proper key management systems. Encrypted data is illegible and practically worthless without its key, even if it is lost, stolen, or accessed without authorisation.&lt;br/&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WCACT_H3_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Cloud encryption protects data from being misused while simultaneously addressing other significant security concerns, such as:&lt;br/&gt;</value>

    <value>As the frequency and severity of cyberattacks rise, IT companies must continue to innovate and lead the way in cyber security. Tech companies, as the first line of defense for all organizations, have a responsibility to stay ahead of cyber risk and ensure that their own security is the best available.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WENTI_H1_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Telecommunications providers, software developers, and managed security service providers are all part of the IT and communications sector. According to studies, the IT sector was the most targeted industry internationally in 2021. The most popular means of an attempted break-in was via email, with businesses receiving an average of 600 unique phishing e-mails every month. Since the tech industry is the first to adopt new technologies, making it particularly vulnerable to cyber-attacks. According to reports, security threats against industrial control systems (ICS) and operational technology (OT) more than tripled since 2020.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WENTI_H2_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>In 2021, researchers have seen 50% more attacks per week on corporate networks compared to 2020. Companies have discovered encryption as one of the best, most efficient, and practical ways to ensure that their sensitive data is protected from everyone, including tech personnel so that only the owner has access to it. In turn, if hackers gain access to a server and steal a user's data, all they have is an unreadable cache of data. Encryption is critical to personal safety as well as enhancing the company’s overall security.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WENTI_H3_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>With an increase in ransomware at IT service providers, IT industries can also utilize Zero-Knowledge Encryption for data security which means that no one, but you (not even the service provider) can access your secured data. Even if files are completely encrypted, if the server has access to the keys, centralized hack attacks can result in an unrecoverable data breach. Zero-Knowledge standards enhance end-to-end encryption as it ensures that no one has access to your files and encryption keys in a readable format. It is one of the most secure ways to protect data privacy online.</value>

  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WEROA_Summary" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Warning – this is a rather technical post ;-) It’s only for those really interested in some of the inner workings of AxCrypt.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WEROA_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Our support people relatively frequently get questions, demands and sometimes even harsh words about why a forgotten password means loss of information.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WEROA_Text10" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>To decrypt a file, you must know the password.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WEROA_Text11" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>If you have encrypted a file, and subsequently lose the password, the file contents are lost.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WEROA_Text12" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>It’s as simple as that.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WEROA_Text13" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Do not forget or lose your password!</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WEROA_Text14" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>If this is not what you’re looking for, you should not be using encryption.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WEROA_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>This is what encryption is about, and what it’s all about!</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WEROA_Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Contrary to for example your email, when you use a password with AxCrypt to encrypt or decrypt files, it’s not used to control your access to the files. Your email provider uses your password to verify that it’s actually you signing in, and if you provide the right password, the software has been programmed to allow the access. If you enter the wrong password, it’ll deny the access. It’s just software making decisions based on the password you provide.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WEROA_Text4" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>With encryption it’s different.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WEROA_Text5" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Encryption takes your password, and then uses it as a controlling parameter to a very complex algorithm that transforms your file to something completely different. If it’s good encryption (and AxCrypt is) the result will be such that nothing about the original content can be derived except a little bit about the size. Not even the size can very reliably be determined from an AxCrypt-encrypted file, since it also applies compression before encryption.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WEROA_Text6" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>An encrypted file is actually ‘physically’ transformed using encryption. After encryption, the file is completely different from the original. The only way to transform it back to the original content, is to apply the encryption in reverse. In order to do this, the correct password must be supplied.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WEROA_Text7" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>There is no software making a decision, comparing the provided password with the correct one. The software just simply tries to apply the decryption algorithm using the provided password. Before encrypting, some special values are added to the data, so when trying the decryption, the software can decide if the result is the correct one or not – but that’s the only ‘decision’ the software makes, and changing that does not change the fact.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WEROA_Text8" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Either the decryption works because the correct password was given, or it does not work because the wrong password was used.</value>

    <value>&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;The file data is encrypted using AES and the session key.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WIAAI_Text11" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;The session key is encrypted with your password, using a special key wrap algorithm, with AES at the core. This encrypted session key is added to the encrypted file.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WIAAI_Text12" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;The session key is encrypted with your AxCrypt ID public key, using RSA-4096. This encrypted session key is addded to the encrypted file.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WIAAI_Text13" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;The session key is encrypted with the AxCrypt ID public key of any other AxCrypt users you’ve chosen to key share the file with. These encrypted session keys are addded to the encrypted file.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WIAAI_Text14" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>To decrypt a file, AxCrypt in principle does the following:</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WIAAI_Text15" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Take your password, find the session key encrypted with a password above, and try to decrypt it. If successful, the decrypted session key is used to decrypt the file.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WIAAI_Text16" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Take your private AxCrypt ID key, find all session keys encrypted with an AxCrypt ID public key, and try to decrypt each. If anyone is successful, the decrypted session key is used to decrypt the file.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WIAAI_Text17" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The key pair is typically generated on our server when an account is created. The private key is temporarily encrypted using our local system key. Once you sign on and set your password, we re-encrypt it using your password.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WIAAI_Text18" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The private key, when encrypted, is actually encrypted as an AxCrypt file of course – but only using your password to encrypt the session key as above. We don’t use any public keys for this encryption.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WIAAI_Text19" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Normally, then, the process is:</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WIAAI_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Actually, it’s more than that. Technically, an AxCrypt ID is a RSA-4096 key pair.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WIAAI_Text20" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;You sign up for an account. We generate and create a key pair on our server, and encrypt the private key temporarily.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WIAAI_Text21" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;You set your password. We re-encrypt the private key with your password. At this point no-one can recover your private key without knowing your password. Not we, not anyone else.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WIAAI_Text22" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;You sign in with an AxCrypt app. The app contacts our server, and downloads the key pair – both private and public keys from the server. The private key is kept encrypted.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WIAAI_Text23" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Whenever opening a file using your sign in password fails, AxCrypt will decrypt the private key, and attempt to decrypt the session key as described above. This will enable you to open files key shared with you, as well as older files encrypted with an earlier password if you have changed the password since then (note: changed – not reset).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WIAAI_Text24" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Changing your AxCrypt ID password in effect means that we take your private key, decrypt it using the old password and then re-encrypt it using the new password. This is how a password change will enable you to open old AxCrypt-encrypted files. Note that they will still in fact open using the old password as well! This is also why you are never dependent on our servers. If you know the original password, you can always open the file. If you have a synchronized copy of the encrypted private key available, you can open any file as long as you have the current password.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WIAAI_Text25" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>All of this key management is done automatically and behind the scenes by AxCrypt, entirely transparently as long as you allow AxCrypt to access our servers.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WIAAI_Text26" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>For advanced users who fully understand the above mechanisms, it is possible to do all of this without our servers. It’s possible to generate AxCrypt ID key pairs, export them, import them etc. We do not recommend anyone to actually do this, since a mistake or misunderstanding easily can lead to data loss or inability to use AxCrypt.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WIAAI_Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>A key pair is a concept used in public key, or asymmetric, cryptography. In this type of cryptography there are two, related keys with the following properties:</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WIAAI_Text4" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;A public key – this key is non-secret and can be used by anyone to encrypt data. But it can’t be used to decrypt anything! We sometimes call this a sharing key.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WIAAI_Text5" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;A private key – this key must be secret and is required in order to decrypt any data encrypted using the public key. We sometimes call this a secret key.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WIAAI_Text6" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Knowing the public key, it is computationally infeasible (i.e. impossible in layman terms) to derive the private key.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WIAAI_Text7" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>When we encrypt any file using AxCrypt, we do so using AES-128/-256. This is a symmetrical strong encrypting algorithm, with a single key used for both encryption and decryption.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WIAAI_Text8" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The process in principle when AxCrypt encrypts a file is as follows:</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WIAAI_Text9" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;A random 128- or 256-bit session key is generated for each time a file is encrypted.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</value>

  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WICS_H1_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>This is where encryption plays a major role. Encryption protects private data and sensitive data and improves the security of communication between client applications and servers. If the data is encrypted, hackers or any unauthorized person or entity would not be able to read it. Encryption is a cyber security measure that protects private and personal information by using unique codes that scramble the information and make it impossible for intruders to read. Despite a data breach, encryption ensures the security of an organization's private information, even if attackers bypass the firewall.</value>

Ransomware attacks are critical for both individual and business users. Business users won’t be able to access data for their daily operations. Most of the time it has been observed, the ransomware attackers do not release information even after the payment is made, but instead try to extort more money.&lt;/li&gt;</value>

Hacking cloud platforms to steal user data is also one of the cyber security challenges for individuals and businesses. We are all aware of the infamous iCloud hack that exposed the private photos of celebrities. If such an attack is made against the company's data, it can pose a huge threat to the organization and even lead to its collapse. Hence it is mandatory to consider many aspects of cloud security and data protection to keep sensitive data protected.&lt;/li&gt;</value>

  <data name="Blog_WIPM_H2_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>It is impossible for a human memory to hold dozens and dozens of passwords. Most people try to use the simplest possible password, such as “12356789” or  “password123” etc. Some remember one great random password and use it for everything. Due to this simple usage of passwords, it is most likely that you might be the latest victim of identity theft. Remarkably, as years passed by, technology has immensely advanced, but more and more data is lost every second.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WIPM_H2_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Password management allows individuals and businesses to store and manage all their passwords in one secure place. Individuals no longer have to remember multiple passwords. The only password a user has to remember is the one master password which is used to open the password manager. A password manager can remember all the infinite passwords for you.</value>

    <value>At an early age, only a handful of passwords were used by an individual. But now, the era has changed. In this digital era, technology has made our lives easier. From ordering food from a favourite restaurant, business meetings at home, online purchases, etc., everything is now possible just at the click of a button on our smartphones in this online world. As and when our life and tasks have become easier, manage passwords associated with these applications has become an important aspect too. The only complication is remembering passwords associated with all the applications. Each and every application or website requires a password to login. Most of the time, it is impossible to remember them all. In accordance with the Google Online Security Survey, it has been found that more than 50 percent of respondents reused the same password for various accounts, which has made the life of hackers easy. According to &lt;a href='https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/list-of-data-breaches-and-cyber-attacks-in-august-2022-97-million-records-breached'&gt;&lt;strong&gt;records&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, there were almost 97 million data breaches and cyber security risks during August 2022. Surveys specify that every 32 seconds, a hacker attacks someone online.  In accordance with the Verizon Data Breach Investigations report, 80 percent of data breaches are caused by weak or reused passwords. This is where the password manager plays the most important role. </value>

    <value>Why does privacy matter? This question has arisen in the context of a global debate. Privacy violations as often slight annoyances. Is there a real harm in mass surveillance? Only people that are engaged in bad acts might have a reason to hide and to care about privacy.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WSPPI_H2_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Privacy is a social norm. We put in passwords on our devices and locks on bathroom doors to help safeguard our privacy and even citizens saying they’re not bothered by it use them to prevent people from entering their private realm. The only people who will seek out privacy, are by definition bad people. Nevertheless we as human beings not just terrorists and criminals, all of us — have things to hide. We all need private moments that we can keep out of persistent, insistent and inquisitive looks.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WSPPI_H2_Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Personal data affects nearly everything, including what messages and content we see on the Internet. Without the knowledge of what data is being used for, we are virtually helpless in today’s world. The internet should be a tool of liberation and democratization but can be used in an unprecedented way allowing mass indiscriminate surveillance. A lack of privacy and thriving mass surveillance remodels a society that breeds conformity and obedience and submission. Don’t agree to make yourself a harmless, uninteresting and non threatening person not to fear people knowing what you’re doing.</value>

    <value>Information, as power, has some unique qualities and has become predominant in our society. Unlike goods it costs nothing to move around, it can be shared over and over again, without exhaustion as long as a partie is interested in disclosing it. Information is the key to how the digital society adds value and redistributes power. In a connected world, information gains power through permanent storage and wide distribution. Yet, once recorded digital information can exist forever. Data has a precious value when its owner can assimilate, affiliate, evaluate and interpret it. The ability to use data and convert it to information is a decisive, critical juncture. It creates a large and considerable gap between those who can use information as a resource and those who cannot.</value>

    <value>Furthermore, there is an exponential increase in new devices and applications that implement and make possible to spy out a private and single person. This high networked society is constantly changing in drastic manners, so is information fluency. Information is collected by giant data processing softwares and could be put out at one’s disadvantage. Prejudice can be caused in invading someone’s private life and divulging some knowledge in a mischievous way. Following up, blackmail and extortion are then negative consequences. By large scale, monitoring and analysis of the population makes it already possible to draw out conclusions on people's behaviors and use it for malicious purposes. By taking the decision to ensure your confidential information you’re not the only benefiting from it but in one way, you commit and perform a service for whole society.</value>

    <value>Privacy rights prevent the governments to spy out on its citizens. The government has a responsibility to protect its citizens, but it often crosses the line when it comes to surveillance. Anti-democratic systems or dictatures might be interested in collecting its population’s private information. They pretend to fight cyber criminality by using an extremely sharp surveillance system but are in fact aiming a total despotism towards its inhabitants. The right to privacy let you engage freely in politics and protects freedom of speech as though.</value>

  <data name="Blog_WSPPI_H4_Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Privacy rights keep groups from using personal data for their own goals. Businesses burst in on the scene as well.

    <value>After reading this article, you can’t say that you didn’t see it coming. Confidential communication is fundamental for liberal democracies. When in the wrong hands, personal information can be wielded as a powerful tool. One of the best ways to protect your data is to encrypt it. End-to-end encryption gives you back control and protects your data from snoopers and prying eyes. Encryption is the best working way so far to secure your data of any form of unwanted access. By taking plain text and using mathematical calculations to turn data into code it is converted into cipher text, only those who have the special key can decrypt your files.

    <value>WikiLeaks is an international non-profit organisation that publishes new leaks so to say confidential information non accessible to the general public.

    <value>Throughout the developing world governments and politicians conceive widely-held beliefs related to the importance of transparency, there has been surprisingly little rigorous evidence on the role that additional information plays in improving someone's situation. The role of information within our society is increasingly questioned. The production of information has sky-roketed in the last few years, one part thanks to its great accessibility as through new ways of data collection and storage. The quantity of information available has by far oustripped our capacity to use it and therefore can be misused if policies and regulations fail to adjust. Quantity doesn't necessarily mean quality. Rarely adequate, the accuracy of information should be controlled to avoid flow of fake news especially regarding political issues.</value>

    <value>Whilst most people are familiar with the term encryption, many have an outdated and misguided idea of what it actually entails. We are all familiar with that movie scene where some guy sits in a dark room surrounded by computers, hacking and encrypting a large organisation's data. Whilst this of course does happen, it is not an accurate depiction of how encryption is used by individuals for day-to-day activities.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WUE_H1_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Encryption is the technique of scrambling or enciphering the material in a particular file so that only the designated recipients have the ability to decipher it. Encryption causes the content of the document to be substituted by letters, numbers and symbols to create a cipher. The original document will then only be accessible to those possessing a key, which is made up of the pattern of which the cipher was encoded. Thus, anyone who does not have access to this key will not be able to decrypt and understand the document.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WUE_H2_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Encryption is absolutely necessary when storing and sharing sensitive information in order to evade unauthorised and illegal processing of personal data. As stated by &lt;a href='https://theverge.com'&gt;theverge.com&lt;/a&gt;, encryption is a fundamental building block of network security. In 2015 alone, Software Alliance found that 423 million identities had been stolen. This suggests that encryption is absolutely a necessary component of digital life in today's world. Private information such as financial and social security data, is transmitted online daily. Thus, in order to allow this transmission to occur safely, all pupils would be more protected through investing in encryption.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WUE_H2_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;h3&gt;What happens without encryption?&lt;/h3&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WUE_H2_Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>In some industries, not encrypting sensitive material is punishable. For example, the Greater Manchester Police was allocated a penalty of £150,000 when an unencrypted USB stick was stolen from an officers home. The USB contained information regarding current police investigations and included private information of over 1,000 individuals. The stick was not password protected and completely unencrypted.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WUE_H3_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>In this case, had the files in question been encrypted, the 1,000 individuals whose information was on the stick would not have been put in danger, and the police would not have been handed the penalty.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WUE_H4_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Here at AxCrypt we use Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), which is an encryption algorithm that is largely considered to be the most secure of those available. The AxCrypt Premium and Business subscription services provide 256-bit encryption, which presents security that is virtually impossible to bypass. It would take millions of years to crack it even for the fastest available computers!</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WUE_H5_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>So in short, we need encryption because as private users or companies we are dealing with massive data breaches, increasing in every passing day. Encryption securely protects data that you don't want anyone else to have access. It can help protect data you send, receive, and store such as text messages stored on your smartphone, running logs saved on your fitness watch, and banking information sent through your online account.</value>

  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WUE_Heading3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The penalty was issued under the pretence that the Greater Manchester Police had failed to introduce convenient technical procedures for the loss of private information. There had been an order which required employees to use encrypted memory sticks, however this rule was never enforced and there were no restrictions on the downloading of material onto external hard drives.</value>

    <value>AxCrypt 2 no longer supports a feature called Self Decrypting Files that was supported in AxCrypt 1.x. What’s a Self Decrypting File? It’s a two things in one: It’s a self-contained executable program (a .exe), with secured data (a .axx file) embedded or appended to it.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WYSASDF_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>AxCrypt 2 no longer supports a feature called &lt;em&gt;Self Decrypting Files&lt;/em&gt; that was supported in AxCrypt 1.x.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WYSASDF_Text10" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;li&gt;Although legacy AxCrypt 1.x self decrypting files had some safeguards against misuse, i.e. encrypting malware to get past firewalls and email filters, it’s still risky business. We do not want to create the perfect toolkit and carrier for malware.&lt;/li&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WYSASDF_Text11" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;li&gt;Another use case is self-contained backups. That’s not a bad idea in theory, but Windows has a hard limit of 2GB size of any .exe , so large backups are not possible to do in this way.&lt;/li&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WYSASDF_Text12" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>All in all, there are simply too many things that speak against &lt;em&gt;Self Decrypting Files&lt;/em&gt;. But we did something better!</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WYSASDF_Text13" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>With AxCrypt 2 we created a fully featured standalone, install-free version instead of the extremely limited self-decrypter of AxCrypt 1. This can be used for all scenarios where the self decryptor was used, with minimal extra work.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WYSASDF_Text14" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>With AxCrypt 2, we have key sharing technology, so you can encrypt files for other recipients and share them without sharing passwords.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WYSASDF_Text15" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>So, instead of wishing for the fundamentally broken idea of &lt;em&gt;Self Decrypting Files&lt;/em&gt;, just embrace the new key sharing technology, and provide the recipient with a &lt;a href='https://account.axcrypt.net/Download/AxCrypt-2.exe'&gt;link to the standalone executable&lt;/a&gt; . If you have a channel that can transmit executables, download it and send it there with the file.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WYSASDF_Text16" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Happy AxCrypting!</value>

  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WYSASDF_Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>When the recipient gets the &lt;em&gt;Self Decrypting File&lt;/em&gt;, (s)he then double-clicks it to run it. It starts executing, and then it reads its own image, finds a .axx secured file embedded, asks for a password and if successful decrypts it and stores it on the recipient’s computer.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WYSASDF_Text4" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Well, just about about everything.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WYSASDF_Text5" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;li&gt;The self decryptor is an executable program that can contain anything, and the recipient has to trust that it does what the sender claims it does. This is not something the recipient should do lightly.&lt;/li&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WYSASDF_Text6" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;li&gt;Since it by definition contains strongly encrypted information, for example another executable software, it is impossible to screen by anti virus software. It can literally contain any level of bad.&lt;/li&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WYSASDF_Text7" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;li&gt;What’s the only reasonable thing to do with something that can contain any kind of malevolent executable software? To block it with prejudice of course!&lt;/li&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WYSASDF_Text8" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;li&gt;Most email providers and clients will refuse to send and/or receive attachments that are executable softwares (.exe, .bat, .cmd, .com, etc). That’s a good thing! But bad for even honest self decryptors.&lt;/li&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_WYSASDF_Text9" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;li&gt;The legacy AxCrypt 1.x encryption only supports passwords, so you still have the problem of transmitting the password to the recipient. If you have more than one recipient, this quickly gets completely out of hand.&lt;/li&gt;</value>

    <value>&lt;strong&gt;Why is Zero Trust needed? &lt;/strong&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_ZTCS_Conclusion_Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Due to the pandemic, Zero Trust has stepped up its game. Since now companies have begun to decentralize their data, assets, applications, and services (DAAS) to different individuals through cloud infrastructure providers. And the fact that internal factors are responsible for 30% of data breaches today, the Zero Trust framework was created, to assist digital businesses in securing valuable assets. As per the Zero Trust model, trust is vulnerability. It indicates that no user, even if they are an employee, can be trusted.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_ZTCS_Conclusion_Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>According to studies, Zero Trust methods result in 50% fewer breaches and 40% less technology spending since everything is interconnected. Companies that embraced Zero Trust were twice as confident in their capacity to bring innovative business models and consumer experiences to market.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_ZTCS_H1_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The primary objective of the Zero Trust model is to minimize the possibility of remote work risks and insider threats, as well as to control third-party interference and cloud risk. The model is a significant shift from the castle-and-moat strategy, which focuses on strengthening the perimeter around the data to keep outsiders out while implicitly trusting insiders. The Zero Trust concept is simple and straightforward: Never trust; always verify. This implies that before any data can be accessed, each user must be validated. Every user request, whether within or outside the company, must be verified and approved in real-time.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_ZTCS_H2_SH1_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The framework of the Zero Trust model is based on verification before trustworthiness; therefore user identification as well as device identity and security, are all validated at multiple stages. Once established, logins and connections time out periodically, requiring users and devices to be re-verified on a regular basis.&lt;br/&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_ZTCS_H2_SH2_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Zero Trust entails granting users only the level of access they require, reducing each user's exposure to the network's vulnerable areas. This requires careful management of user permissions.&lt;br/&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_ZTCS_H2_SH3_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The Zero Trust system keeps track of how many different devices are attempting to connect to their network, verifies that each one is allowed, and assesses each one to certify it hasn't been hacked; while using MFA to authenticate each user by means of 2-factor authorization. These factors reduce the network's attack surface even further.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_ZTCS_H2_SH4_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Micro-segmentation is the method adopted by Zero Trust of dividing security perimeters into small distinct zones so that different sections of the network can have independent access. Without additional authorization, a person or program with access to one of the zone will not be able to access any of the others; thus effectively preventing lateral movement from unknown attackers.</value>

    <value>Zero Trust secures remote workforces better than traditional approaches, and the benefits go beyond security to boost productivity and agility. In this article, we'll look at some of Zero Trust's most important security features.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_ZTCS_H3_SH1_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Key sharing enables you to collaborate and connect with other members without jeopardizing the confidentiality of your data.  Using AxCrypt's key sharing function you can give anyone data access and withdraw it whenever you want; you don't even have to disclose your own password. For more info on AxCrypt key sharing check our key sharing tutorial on&lt;a href=' https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUVWbmiEFSs'&gt; YouTube &lt;/a&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Blog_ZTCS_H3_SH2_Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Master Key is highly secure, it can be viewed as an automatic sharing of files with the administrators of the business. It allows business managers to recover files from other members of the company. This avoids the possibility of losing vital files.&lt;a href='https://www.axcrypt.net/blog/master-key'&gt; Read more about AxCrypt's master key feature here&lt;/a&gt;</value>

    <value>The advantages of using a Zero Trust architecture extend well beyond security. All of this, however, might be in vain if it is not successfully executed. This model is all about encryption and access control, both of which rely on cryptography. Cryptography, in turn, is based on keys. Cryptography's protection will be rendered useless if a key is compromised. As a result, keys must be kept secure at all times and maintained correctly for optimal security.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</value>

  <data name="FaqAccessDenied" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Why do I get ‘Access Denied’ and/or my file names are in green text?</value>
  </data>
  <data name="FaqAccessDeniedAnswer1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>AxCrypt is accessed via the right-click context menu, under the heading ‘AxCrypt’. There is also a built-in encryption in some versions of Windows, which is accessed in a similar way, but under the heading ‘Properties’, then the button ‘Advanced’ and finally the check box ‘Encrypt contents to secure data’. This encryption uses a feature called &lt;a href='https://support.microsoft.com/windows'&gt;Encrypting File System&lt;/a&gt;, or EFS for short.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="FaqAccessDeniedAnswer2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>There are typically two reasons for getting ‘Access Denied’ messages. Both occur when files are either moved to a new system, or Windows is (re)installed on an existing system. One situation is a problem, the other is not.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="FaqAccessDeniedAnswer3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>If the file names in Windows Explorer are shown in black text, then you’re likely just having an NTFS ownership issue, and this is easily remedied. Please Google for ‘ntfs take ownership’ (without the quotes) to find suggested solutions.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="FaqAccessDeniedAnswer4" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>If the file names in Windows Explorer are shown in green text, then you’ve inadvertently encrypted them with EFS. This might mean your files are lost. Please Google for ‘efs access denied’ for explanations and possible remedies.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="FaqAccessDeniedAnswer5" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>EFS may in some cases be a useful feature, and can for some scenarios be a better solution than AxCrypt. However... Beware: There be Dragons!</value>
  </data>
  <data name="FaqAccessDeniedAnswer6" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Because of the way EFS is implemented, it is also likely to be the single most common cause of data loss in Windows environments. If you’re a computer security wizard, and have a full understanding of X.509 encryption certificates, and how the Windows Certificate Stores work and interact with user credentials, then you won’t have a problem as long as you’re careful to ensure backups of the appropriate certificates and keys. If, however, the previous sentence confuses you then you should probably not be using EFS because of the mentioned risk of data loss when moving files to a new system, or (re)installing Windows, or resetting passwords, or…</value>

  <data name="FaqAntivirusWarning" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I got a warning from my antivirus software. Is AxCrypt infected?</value>
  </data>
  <data name="FaqAntivirusWarningAnswer1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>No, the official distribution does not intentionally contain anything that even remotely can be called malicious. It is very unlikely to be infected by anything unintentionally. Please read a lengthier blog post for details why we can make that statement.</value>

    <value>Anyone can still delete my secured files, why is that?</value>
  </data>
  <data name="FaqAnyoneCanDeleteFileAnswer1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Securing a file with AxCrypt protects your information from prying eyes and undetected modification or corruption. It does not protect against destruction, willfully or by accident.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="FaqAnyoneCanDeleteFileAnswer2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>It bears repetition: Your protection against data loss is regular backups.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="FaqAnyoneCanDeleteFileAnswer3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Technically it’s not really possible to reliably protect your data against destruction with software – except backup software. Of course, software can add safeguards that make it harder to do it by mistake, or even maliciously but in the end you can’t protect against vandals that way.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="FaqAnyoneCanDeleteFileAnswer4" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>You should be using the NTFS file system and let every user of the computer sign in as a separate, restricted, user. No-one should normally run as administrator. This will protect your files against deletion by other users of the same computer, but it will not protect against yourself – or any agent acting on your behalf. Please remember that viruses and trojan intrusions will be acting as if on the behalf of the compromised user!</value>
  </data>
  <data name="FaqAnyoneCanDeleteFileAnswer5" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>If your system is compromised by a virus or a trojan, your secured files will be protected from theft – but not from destruction.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="FaqAnyoneCanDeleteFileAnswer6" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>AxCrypt is not intended to protect against destruction, and there is to our knowledge no such serious software available except backup software. Any software claiming to provide such protection should be examined carefully to understand exactly what it is it protects against and how. Always backup your data regardless of other measures taken.</value>

  <data name="FaqDamagedFileAnswer1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>If your secured file is corrupt, you will get a message which will refer to the HMAC being incorrect or some similar text.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="FaqDamagedFileAnswer2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>This message implies that the file is recognized by AxCrypt, and that you have entered the correct password and/or key file, and there is hope!</value>
  </data>
  <data name="FaqDamagedFileAnswer3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Another message that may be seen will refer to the GUID being incorrect. This indicates a severe error in the file to the extent that it’s not even recognized as an AxCrypt file. In most cases this is because the file is simply not a file secured by AxCrypt.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="FaqDamagedFileAnswer4" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>AxCrypt has some features for recovery of damaged files, but there are some limitations. You must also be careful, and start by marking the original (damaged) file as read-only, and then make a copy of it – and always only work on the copy!</value>

    <value>Please contact support for further instructions on how to proceed.</value>

  <data name="FaqDamagedFileAnswer6" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Your protection against data loss is regular backups. Please backup all your important files – secured as well as files without security. AxCrypt is not intended to provide any protection against data loss – only against disclosure and undetected manipulation.</value>

    <value>What is the difference between AxCrypt 1.x and 2.x?</value>
  </data>
  <data name="FaqDifference1&amp;2Answer1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>AxCrypt 1.x is a legacy version. That means it is outdated and there is no longer any support for it, whereas AxCrypt 2.x is the version that we are continuously working on to keep improving it. It’s absolutely not recommended to use 1.x. We recommend all users, old and new, to always use the most current released version of AxCrypt, which can be downloaded &lt;a href='/download'&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="FaqDifference1&amp;2Answer2" xml:space="preserve">

    <value>What are the major differences between the standalone version and installer version of AxCrypt?</value>

  <data name="FaqDifferenceStandaloneInstallerAnswer1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The installer version comes with some additional features (e.g. context menu integration) compared to the lightweight, standalone version.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="FaqDifferenceStandaloneInstallerAnswer2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The standalone version is directly executable – no installation is required. In this version, you will not get AxCrypt’s right click context in Explorer, nor will you be able to open files by double-clicking.</value>

    <value>Your email will be used to name your AxCrypt ID, and will also be used as the name when authenticating against the server in order to access premium functionality. It may also be used to notify you of critical software updates, new features and other communications from us such as a newsletter. The AxCrypt ID itself will be used to allow others to share files securely with you without the need to share passwords, and for other possible future features such as enabling others to validate digital signatures. Since we offer premium features from a server based infrastructure, we need something to identify you by. Currently this is your email since it is universally available and accepted.

    <value>If you get an error message “File Encryption for .NET and Mono has stopped working. A problem caused the program to stop working correctly. Windows will close the program and notify you if a solution is available.” the most likely cause is a software called “Lavasoft Web Companion”. This is not compatible with modern versions of Windows, and it modifies the way the network is accessed in a way that causes AxCrypt and other programs to crash.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="FaqFileEncryptionNotWorkingAnswer2" xml:space="preserve">

  <data name="FaqForgotPassword" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I forgot my password. What to do?</value>
  </data>
  <data name="FaqForgotPasswordAnswer1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The basic rule is: If you lose or forget your password or key-file, your documents are lost. There is no back-door into AxCrypt.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="FaqForgotPasswordAnswer2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The only way to recover a lost password is to try all likely combinations.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="FaqForgotPasswordAnswer3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>All that being said, there is a special case where we could possibly help you. If you think you know your password, but not quite, or if it’s less than 5 characters long – then we can write and adapt a special program that will try many combinations automatically. This is called a brute force attack.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="FaqForgotPasswordAnswer4" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>AxCrypt is specifically engineered to counter &lt;a href='/axcrypt-brute-force'&gt;&lt;strong&gt;brute force&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; attacks, and does it rather well, so this will only work when the number of combinations to try is very small, let’s say less than a million.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="FaqForgotPasswordAnswer5" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>If you think you may be in a position where you can narrow down the possible combinations enough for us, then there is a slight chance to recover the password using a utility that will attempt to try many possibilities according to a pattern you provide. Please &lt;a href=\"mailto:support@axcrypt.net\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;contact support&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; if would like to try the brute force utility.</value>

    <value>How many passes does wipe do/Why only one pass wiping?</value>
  </data>
  <data name="FaqHowManyWipeAnswer1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Wipe and Delete only overwrites once with pseudo random data. We’re currently not planning to implement DoD 5220.22 (NISPOM) sanitization, nor Gutmann 35-pass secure-wipe. The cost of retrieving single-overwritten data is prohibitive as it is. If the attacker has the resources for that (as well as getting physical access to the disk) there are many easier and surer ways of getting at the data.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="FaqHowManyWipeAnswer2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>A PC is such an insecure and uncontrolled environment, that to use DoD-style wiping in a running system is severe overkill and misleading. Such wiping should be used prior to destruction or re-use of hard disks, and then only from a stand-alone diskette and CD so that the entire disk surface may be wiped, regardless of operating system structures. We recommend Boot and Nuke for this purpose.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="FaqHowManyWipeAnswer3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The purpose of AxCrypt wiping is to protect from use of common undelete tools, not to protect from electron microscopy or special diagnostic hardware and software available to hard disc manufacturers. Wiping 35 times also takes a lot of time...</value>

    <value>How do I renew my subscription?</value>
  </data>
  <data name="FaqHowToRenewAnswer1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>New subscribers have a subscription that will automatically renew at the end of the subscription period, using the initial payment method. To check your subscription status, login to the account site, and check it on the &lt;a href='https://account.axcrypt.net/en/Home/Login'&gt;My AxCrypt ID page&lt;/a&gt;. You will see the date it renews on there.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="FaqHowToRenewAnswer2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>If it mentions that the subscription will expire on a certain date, you either subscribed before June 25th 2020, or you cancelled your automatic payments. In that case, you will have to renew it yourself.</value>

  <data name="FaqKeysAndPasswordsAnswer1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Yes, but encrypted with your password which we do not store. There is no essential change in the security compared to previous versions. You must still use a strong password, and keep it secret.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="FaqKeysAndPasswordsAnswer2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The only thing that must be secret with AxCrypt is your password. Nothing else, not the software, not the secured files, not the secured account keys or anything else. As long as your password is both strong and secret, your secured files remain secure. Even if our server would be compromised, the permanently stored sensitive data stored there is encrypted with your password, which we do not store.</value>

  <data name="FaqPasswordRecoveryCorporate" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Does AxCrypt support password recovery for corporate use?</value>
  </data>
  <data name="FaqPasswordRecoveryCorporateAnswer1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>If you represent a company thinking about using AxCrypt, you may be worried about the case of an employee quitting and not telling the password to his or her files. The question then is if you can set a password recovery policy?</value>
  </data>
  <data name="FaqPasswordRecoveryCorporateAnswer2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>If an employee quits, and refuses to give back company property your response should be to report the person to the police for theft, and/or take other legal action. This applies just as much to his laptop as the intellectual property owned by the company which is stored on the laptop or the company servers.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="FaqPasswordRecoveryCorporateAnswer3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>There are enterprise solutions that do implement functionality like this, but the most common reason to use AxCrypt is because of it’s simplicity to implement. Enterprise solutions demand quite a bit of infrastructure, maintenance and can be quite complex to install. Unfortunately, enterprise solutions do not really protect against disgruntled (ex-) employees anyway, although they do provide protection against accidental password loss.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="FaqPasswordRecoveryCorporateAnswer4" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>So, AxCrypt is kept simple to use and deploy, at the cost of no password recovery. Data loss concerns should be addressed via backup procedures of both passwords and data, and issues with employees leaving without divulging passwords should be treated as any other destructive or illegal behavior by such a person.</value>

  <data name="FaqSignInWithoutPasswordAnswer1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>If you’ve just downloaded AxCrypt 2, entered your email and gotten a message that you already have an account, but don’t know the password, you need to issue a &lt;a href='https://account.axcrypt.net/en/Home/PasswordReset'&gt;password reset&lt;/a&gt;.

    <value>How can I stop anyone from securing my files?</value>
  </data>
  <data name="FaqStopFromSecuringAnswer1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Short answer: You can’t. Follow-up question: Why would you want to?</value>
  </data>
  <data name="FaqStopFromSecuringAnswer2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>If you install AxCrypt, anyone with access to your computer can secure your files. This is sometimes seen as a risk with installing AxCrypt. However, this is not the case. The real risk is with ‘…anyone with access to your computer’. Anyone who can access your computer and run an installed copy of AxCrypt, can also install AxCrypt or any other security or deletion software. Anyone who can access your computer can delete your files, and probably format your hard disk. Anyone with physical access can also throw it out the window, steal it, use it for target practice with a shotgun or any other activity that may prove detrimental to the health of your files.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="FaqStopFromSecuringAnswer3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The point is that it makes no sense to restrict access to AxCrypt – it’s the access to the computer that needs to be restricted! That’s why you should always use a password protected screen saver and always have a password on your account. Because then, if your files are secured with AxCrypt, your information will stay safe even in the face of loss or theft of your computer or media with the files on.</value>

    <value>What happens when my subscription expires?</value>

  <data name="FaqWhatHappensExpireAnswer1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>If you stop subscribing to Premium or Business, you will fall back to the Viewer or Free plan after the end of your subscription period. You won’t have to worry about your files, because you’ll never get locked out of your data.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="FaqWhatHappensExpireAnswer2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>With the Windows version, your files will be re-encrypted with 128-bit AES encryption, rather than the 256-bit AES algorithm that was used when you were on a subscription. If you are using AxCrypt on macOS, you will be unable to encrypt new files. You can still decrypt and view the encrypted files. The content of encrypted files can’t be updated. That means you have to either decrypt them, or get a paid subscription to keep using AxCrypt like before.</value>

  <data name="FaqWhyPasswordSignIn" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Why does AxCrypt only ask for a password during sign-in? Isn’t that insecure?</value>
  </data>
  <data name="FaqWhyPasswordSignInAnswer1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>While you are signed in to AxCrypt, offline or online, AxCrypt will not ask you again for the same password. This feature makes usage of AxCrypt much more convenient, and saves you from the trouble of re-entering the password every time.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="FaqWhyPasswordSignInAnswer2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Security is a chain only as strong as its weakest link. In your local system, there are so many other ways to get at your data that to sacrifice the convenience of a password cache just to ‘feel’ safer, was not thought to be a good idea.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="FaqWhyPasswordSignInAnswer3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>But what’s then the use of AxCrypt if anyone can walk up to my PC and just double-click?</value>
  </data>
  <data name="FaqWhyPasswordSignInAnswer4" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Under the heading Documentation &gt; Security &gt; Local PC Security you will find a discussion about what is needed to protect your PC locally, and why. The important thing for this discussion is: If anyone can walk up to your PC and it’s not protected by a password-protected screen-saver you have no protection anyway! All that is needed for a would-be attacker is access to a PC with for example a diskette or CD-drive, a USB-port or an Internet connection, and it’s a few seconds work to install a keylogger or a trojan. Do not trust a PC that has been left unattended and unprotected.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="FaqWhyPasswordSignInAnswer5" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The second reason for the password cache is that if you do not need to enter it every time, you may actually find it reasonable to use a longer and stronger password than otherwise, thus increasing security.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="FaqWhyPasswordSignInAnswer6" xml:space="preserve">

    <value>As private persons, we nowadays store lots of information on our computers that is not necessarily secret, but just simply private. Many of us also at times have the need to use employer-owned computers and servers, as well as public servers, to store such information. It might be copies of electronic invoices, private letters, your CV etc.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="FaqWhySecureAnswer3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>In all these situations you might feel a little more comfortable knowing that regardless of physical access to the files by network administrators, service personnel or even other family members in your home network, your private information is still kept private.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="FaqWhySecureAnswer4" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>As employees we frequently are responsible for information that is sensitive in various ways. It might be salaries if you’re a manager, or customer data if you’re in sales or support etc. This information is kept in confidence by you, and you have a responsibility to care for it as best you can.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="FaqWhySecureAnswer5" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>In many cases it’s not really enough to just store it on the corporate network server and apply appropriate restrictive access permissions. The information and files are still always available to support staff, network administrators etc. Even if you trust your colleagues, as you should, mistakes do happen and sometimes it’s simply human to be curious. Anyone finding a file with his or her name on it will be sorely tempted to sneak a peek…</value>
  </data>
  <data name="FaqWhySecureAnswer6" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Finally, there are an increasing number of cases where legislation and similar rules come into play such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, HIPAA, where encryption of confidential data is required under certain circumstances.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="FaqWhySecureAnswer7" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>In these and similar situations encryption programs such as AxCrypt provide a secure and convenient method to provide privacy and confidentiality as appropriate.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="FaqWhyTimeStap" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Why is the file time-stamp set to the time of securing the file?</value>
  </data>
  <data name="FaqWhyTimeStapAnswer1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The default operation of AxCrypt when securing a plain-text file, is to store the original files time-stamps inside the secured file and to set the time-stamps of the resulting secured file to the time when it was most recently secured. The rationale for this behavior is as follows:</value>
  </data>
  <data name="FaqWhyTimeStapAnswer2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Many backup and file-synchronization software programs depend on the modification time of files to determine if it has been modified since the last run. This test fails, if the secured file retains the original date of the plain-text file and at worst the file does not get copied/backed up etc.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="FaqWhyTimeStapAnswer3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Good security software will ensure that securing the same file twice produces completely different secured files, to make it harder to determine if the file is the same as another file, or another earlier version of a file. If the time-stamp is retained, an attacker will get a high-precision time-stamp that more or less uniquely identifies each and every file thus leaking what might be important information about the file. (File size will remain the same, since the securing is deterministic, but this is a much weaker assertion).</value>
  </data>
  <data name="FaqWhyTimeStapAnswer4" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Semantically, securing a file is a transformation of the file, and this should be reflected in the time-stamp. Note that the original plain-text time-stamps still will be restored if the security is removed from the file!</value>
  </data>
  <data name="FaqWhyTimeStapAnswer5" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>If AxCrypt ever should support multi-file archives, there’s no choice but to use the time of securing it, otherwise it’ll make it very inconsistent – which time-stamp should a multi-file AxCrypt archive which happens to contain exactly one file use (which by the way is the case today, the file format supports multiple files, but AxCrypt has not implemented this functionality yet).</value>

    <value>What is the GDPR?</value>
  </data>
  <data name="GdprBlock1Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a binding legislative act concerning the protection of personal data and individual rights. The GDPR replaces the Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="GdprBlock1Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>It was designed to harmonize data privacy laws across Europe, to protect and empower all EU citizens data privacy and to reshape the way organizations approach data privacy. The GDPR requires companies to implement reasonable ways to protect their data, such as encryption, to protect it against data loss or exposure.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="GdprBlock1Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The enforcement date of the GDPR is 25 May 2018.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="GdprBlock2Heading" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Who is affected by it?</value>
  </data>
  <data name="GdprBlock2Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The GDPR applies to all organizations located within the EU, or outside of the EU, processing and holding the personal data of EU citizens, in order to: offer goods or services, or monitor their behaviour within the EU.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="GdprBlock3Heading" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>How can file encryption help towards compliance?</value>
  </data>
  <data name="GdprBlock3Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>As Recital 83 in the GDPR states:</value>
  </data>
  <data name="GdprBlock3Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>”In order to maintain security and to prevent processing in infringement of this Regulation, the controller or processor should evaluate the risks inherent in the processing and implement measures to mitigate those risks, such as encryption.”</value>
  </data>
  <data name="GdprBlock3Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Organizations have to make sure that their personal data is stored securely, whether on-premise or cloud-based, in order to prevent costly data breaches. Files that have been encrypted will be rendered useless when breached.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="GdprBlock4Heading" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>What are the penalties for non-compliance?</value>
  </data>
  <data name="GdprBlock4Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Organizations can be fined up to 4% of annual global turnover for breaching GDPR or €20 Million – whichever is greater. This is the maximum fine that can be imposed for the most serious infringements. It is important to note that these rules apply to both controllers and processors – meaning ‘clouds’ will not be exempt from GDPR enforcement.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="GdprBlock5Heading" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>How does the GDPR handle personal data breaches?</value>
  </data>
  <data name="GdprBlock5Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>In the case of a personal data breach, the controller shall without undue delay and, where feasible, not later than 72 hours after having become aware of it, notify the personal data breach to the supervisory authority.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="GdprBlock6Heading" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>What are my main responsibilities under the GDPR?</value>
  </data>
  <data name="GdprBlock6Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>If your organization handles personal data, the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) states that you are expected to put into place comprehensive but proportionate governance measures. These measures should minimize the risk of breaches and uphold the protection of personal data. The exact responsibilities that apply are different for every organization, depending on its size, industry and what kind of data is being stored.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="GdprBlock7Heading" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Is my website GDPR compliant?</value>
  </data>
  <data name="GdprBlock7Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>According to &lt;a href='https://www.vpnmentor.com/blog/report-only-34-percent-of-websites-in-the-eu-are-ready-for-gdpr/'&gt;vpnMentor&lt;/a&gt; as little as 34% of websites in the EU are currently GDPR compliant. “Most of the websites either have old privacy policies, and in some cases no privacy policy at all, and are in no way ready for the stricter privacy guidelines.”</value>
  </data>
  <data name="GdprBlock7Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>In order to determine which websites collect data, and therefore need to update their privacy policy, vpnMentor based their research on sites that use MailChimp to collect user Email addresses. They have collected as many 100 websites per country, and looked at their privacy policy, if they had one, to determine if it was GDPR compliant.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="GdprBlock8Heading" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>How will Brexit impact the GDPR? Will it apply to businesses in the UK?</value>
  </data>
  <data name="GdprBlock8Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>If your business is located in the UK, it will also have to comply with the EU regulation. The UK has stated that it will comply with the GDPR, and that its compliance will not be affected by Brexit.</value>

    <value>Master key introduction</value>
  </data>
  <data name="MasterKeyBlock1Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Master key is a feature which enables business administrators to recover files of the business members.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="MasterKeyBlock1Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Imagine an important financial document being encrypted after creating the yearly revenue report. During the following year a new financial team is put in place, and when it's time for the yearly report they realize the financial document the previous team used, is now encrypted with credentials no one has access to any longer.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="MasterKeyBlock1Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Enter Master key! With Master key enabled, the administrators of the business can always recover any file encrypted by the business members. In the above case the new financial team just has to ask their administrator and the financial document can easily be recovered, even if the original user left the company.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="MasterKeyBlock1Text4" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>As long as the business has one or a couple administrators who make sure to keep track of their credentials, no files will ever be lost due to employees leaving or forgetting their passwords.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="MasterKeyBlock2Heading" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Master key and security</value>
  </data>
  <data name="MasterKeyBlock2Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>When enabling master key, business administrators can recover any document encrypted by their members. This, as mentioned, eliminates the risk of losing access to critical files. But is it secure?</value>
  </data>
  <data name="MasterKeyBlock2Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>In terms of security, you can view Master key as an automatic sharing of files with the administrators of the business. Administrators will automatically be able to recover files which has their Master key applied. This is no less secure than simply using AxCrypt's tried and tested Key Sharing feature.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="MasterKeyBlock2Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Of course, business administrators need to be extra careful to choose good passwords and keeping their account safe at all times.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="MasterKeyBlock3Heading" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Enabling master key</value>
  </data>
  <data name="MasterKeyBlock3Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Master key can be enabled from the &lt;a href='https://account.axcrypt.net/en/Business/ManageSubscriptionMembers'&gt;manage subscription page&lt;/a&gt;.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="MasterKeyBlock3Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>After enabling Master key, all existing member of the business have to approve the change. This is an important security consideration, an existing user should never feel like this feature was hidden from them. Who has accepted the Master key feature can be seen in the user table.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="MasterKeyBlock3Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>If a user has not accepted Master key, it will not be applied to files they encrypt, so make sure everyone in your business accepts the feature.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="MasterKeyBlock3Text4" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Note! Files encrypted before enabling Master key will of course not be possible to recover. Old files have to be re-encrypted after the user having accepted master key.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="MasterKeyBlock3Text5" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>For new businesses, or new members of existing businesses, Master key will be automatically approved when members joins the business.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="MasterKeyBlock4Heading" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Using Master Key</value>
  </data>
  <data name="MasterKeyBlock4Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Once Master key has been enabled, it will be automatically applied to all files encrypted by members of the business. You can see if Master key has been applied by the Master key icon shown in the application.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="MasterKeyBlock4Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>If a file has this icon, then any business administrator can recover the file.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="MasterKeyBlock4Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>That's it! As you can see, Master key is very easy to use and nothing your business member ever have to consider or spend time on.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="MasterKeyBlock4Text4" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Please note that even though business administrators can recover files using Master key, this should not be used in normal usage. If a file is intended to be opened by a business administrator, then the file should Key shared with that user, just as with any other user.</value>

    <value>AxCrypt has a sophisticated password strength evaluator based on measuring the actual strength of the password. It must also be at least 8 effective characters long.

We evaluate the password by estimating the strength, which is based on how long and complex the password is.

The evaluation entirely disregards parts of the password that is recognized as being among the 1,000 most common passwords, as well as white space. For example the password 'secretX password Y 123456' is evaluated as just 'XY', since spaces, 'secret', 'password' and '123456' are ignored!

We classify the password in 4 categories of increasing strength, were we do not accept any password in the lowest category. The above example is not accepted for that reason.</value>

    <value>As an important part of the work of creating a user-friendly website, we look at the user pattern of those who visit the site. We analyze user behaviour to make the user experience better. The purpose of using cookies is therefore to improve the customer experience. To analyze the information, we use the analysis tool Google Analytics. Google Analytics uses cookies/cookies (small text files that the site stores on the user's computer), which records the user's IP address, and provides information about each user's online movement. Examples of what the statistics give us answers to are; how many people visit different pages, how long the visit lasts, which sites the users come from and which browsers are used. None of the cookies allows us to associate information about your use of the site with you as an individual. Cookie data is automatically deleted 14 months after registration. You can do it yourself and manage the use of cookies by adjusting settings on your browser. The information collected by Google Analytics is stored on Google's servers in the United States. Information received is subject to Google guidelines for Privacy. An IP address is defined as personal information because it can be traced back to a particular hardware and thus to an individual. We anonymize the user's IP address before the information is stored and processed by Google. Thus, the anonymized IP address cannot be used to identify the individual user. Your IP address is also logged for a short period by our web servers. The user's IP-address, time of day, website address, HTTP status, number of bytes sent, HTTP referrer and HTTP user agent is logged for 15 days. Beyond this point, the data is deleted.</value>

Information about tips is not logged with us but is only used there and then to post the tip of the social networking site. However, we cannot guarantee that the online community will not log this information. All such services should, therefore, be used wisely. You may contact the relevant service provider or online community to receive information about its collection, use, processing, and personal data protection.

    <value>How can AxCrypt help with the GDPR?</value>
  </data>
  <data name="RegulatoryComplianceBlock1Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a binding legislative act concerning the protection of personal data and individual rights. It was designed to harmonize data privacy laws across Europe, to protect and empower all EU citizens data privacy, and to reshape the way organizations approach data privacy.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="RegulatoryComplianceBlock1Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The GDPR requires companies and organizations to implement reasonable ways to protect their data, such as encryption, to protect it against data loss or exposure. This is where AxCrypt can help.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="RegulatoryComplianceBlock1Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>As Recital 83 in the GDPR states: ”In order to maintain security and to prevent processing in infringement of this Regulation, the controller or processor should evaluate the risks inherent in the processing and implement measures to mitigate those risks, such as encryption.”</value>
  </data>
  <data name="RegulatoryComplianceBlock1Text4" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>You have to make sure that personal data is stored securely, whether on-premise or cloud-based, in order to prevent costly data breaches. Files that have been encrypted will be rendered useless when breached.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="RegulatoryComplianceBlock1Text5" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Below are some resources that can further inform you.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="RegulatoryComplianceBlock2Heading" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Is AxCrypt HIPAA compliant?</value>
  </data>
  <data name="RegulatoryComplianceBlock2ListItem1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Access Control/Encryption and Decryption – AES-128/AES-256</value>

    <value>Security/Integrity Controls, Encryption AES-128/AES-256/HMAC-SHA-512</value>
  </data>
  <data name="RegulatoryComplianceBlock2Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act protects the privacy and security of health information. Compliance of HIPAA only applies to organizations and processes. It does not apply to software, meaning that an encryption solution such as AxCrypt can’t be HIPAA compliant. Although, AxCrypt may suffice as (part of) a Technical Safeguard.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="RegulatoryComplianceBlock2Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The appropriate use of encryption and other Technical Safeguards is governed by the HIPAA Security Standards, 45 CFR 160, 162 and 164. The relevant section is 164.312 Technical Safeguards. No recommendations or requirements concerning specific encryption technologies are made there either, it’s specifically pointed out that the regulation is technology-neutral. It’s up to each and every organization to evaluate its position and risks, and then implement required or addressable specifications.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="RegulatoryComplianceBlock2Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>You have to make sure that personal data is stored securely, whether on-premise or cloud-based, in order to prevent costly data breaches. Files that have been encrypted will be rendered useless when breached.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="RegulatoryComplianceBlock2Text4" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Although the standard in no way refers to it except in comments, the CMS Internet Security Policy, which is the current view of Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services for their own use, does specify some minimal technology levels for certain cases. AxCrypt meets these requirements for transmission over the Internet – but your organization must independently evaluate if is sufficient to use the same level as the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="RegulatoryComplianceBlock2Text5" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The parts where AxCrypt may (and should) suffice as (part of) a Technical Safeguard are:</value>
  </data>
  <data name="RegulatoryComplianceBlock2Text6" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The HIPAA Security Standard does allow the use of encryption as the basis for Access Control, that is to say to protect the privacy of data at rest (stored on a hard disk as opposed to traversing the Internet for example). AxCrypt will meet most organizations requirements here too.</value>

    <value>AxCrypt runs on 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Windows. On Windows 8 and 10, AxCrypt works in desktop mode, but there is no Metro app available yet, nor does AxCrypt run on Windows RT.

    <value>Why is AxCrypt secure?</value>
  </data>
  <data name="SecurityBlock1Text" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>AxCrypt is secure because it endeavors to only use accepted practices and algorithms and does not attempt to invent any new encryption algorithms or methods.  It’s also open source; Anyone may inspect the source code, check it for errors, omissions or back doors. It has been used and inspected for vulnerabilities for over 15 years and tried by more than 30 million users, without any known weaknesses.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="SecurityBlock2Heading" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>How secure is AxCrypt?</value>
  </data>
  <data name="SecurityBlock2Text" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>This question breaks down to effective encryption key lengths. The key length used is 128 or 256 bits – exhaustive search is not currently believed to be an option in either case and it is computationally infeasible in cryptographic terms. The problem lies with the passwords used – this is the weak point. You can read more about what to consider when choosing a password below.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="SecurityBlock3Heading" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Password considerations</value>
  </data>
  <data name="SecurityBlock3ListItem1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The name of the file, as well as the size, may be recovered.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="SecurityBlock3ListItem2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>If the file has been viewed or edited with an application that creates temporary copies of the content (such as Microsoft Office), those temporary copies may still be available for undeletion on your hard disk.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="SecurityBlock3Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>AxCrypt uses AES-128 or AES-256 in the Premium version – but if you want to achieve that level of security you must give it 128 or 256 bits of truly ‘random’ data. This is very hard to do, but the easiest way to even approach this is to use the password generator included in Premium.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="SecurityBlock3Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>To actually get 128 or 256 bits, you’ll in practice have to save this password in a text file, and then keep that text file very secret.Using typical English language in a password, 128 bits is approximately equivalent to 10 ‘random’ words, and 256 bits thus twice this. Do not use meaningful sentences and absolutely not famous or even obscure quotations!By introducing variations on the case, as well as non-alphabetic characters you can reduce the number of words necessary. It’s not recommended to use less than 5 words. If you use a completely random selection of upper and lower-case letters and digits, you need 22 characters to achieve 128 bits security, and thus 44 characters for 256 bits. (The above is a slight simplification of the issue, but it should serve.)The shredding, or wiping, feature of AxCrypt allows you to erase files in a way that makes it impossible to recover the contents with undeletion software. However, there are some caveats:</value>

    <value>Account Keys</value>
  </data>
  <data name="SecurityBlock5Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>An account key is what enables the implementation of various new rich features, such as allowing other team members to open secured files with their own passwords. In technical terms, an AxCrypt Account key consists of a public key pair composed of a public (non-secret) and a private (secret) part and some other meta data.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="SecurityBlock5Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The account key is always kept secured with your password as well, although one part of it is not secret and is used when securing files for you and your team. For you, the benefit is that you can change the password for all files in one single operation. For your team members, the benefit is that you and your team can allow each other to open secured files without sharing passwords by just specifying the email address of the other member.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="SecurityBlock5Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Anyone can use your email address to allow you to open a secured file with your own passphrase, and you can allow anyone with an email address to open a file secured by you. All this is enabled by the public part of the account key being available on our server.</value>

    <value>Algorithms</value>
  </data>
  <data name="SecurityBlock6Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The cryptological primitives are AES-128 or AES-256 for bulk encryption, PBKDF2 with HMAC-512 for key deriviation, 4096-bit RSA for the account key, and HMAC-512 for integrity checking.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="SecurityBlock6Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The algorithms used are deemed secure as such, to the best of our knowledge, by the US Government and the Internet community. Please see the documents package and the source code for details.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="SecurityBlock6Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Key wrapping of the password is done using the NIST specification for AES Key Wrap. The key derived from the password with PBKDF2-SHA512 is only used as a key encrypting key.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="SecurityBlock6Text4" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>As a brute force counter measure, key wrapping is done with at least 5 000 iterations, increasing the work effort with approximately 12 bits. The actual iteration count is determined dynamically, a typical value is 25 000 to 100 000, adding 14-17 bits of effective key-length. The faster machine you install AxCrypt on – the better the security!</value>
  </data>
  <data name="SecurityBlock6Text5" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>AxCrypt uses the Advanced Encryption Standard with 128-bit or 256-bit keys in Counter mode with a ‘random’ IV for the data encryption.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="SecurityBlock6Text6" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>For integrity verification AxCrypt uses HMAC-SHA512, i.e. Hash Message Authentication Code using SHA-512 with 512-bit output.</value>

  <data name="SecurityBlock6Text7" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The pseudo random number generator (PRNG) used is primarily the operating system provided one, in some cases with added entropy added.</value>

  <data name="SecurityBlock6Text8" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>There may well be bugs in our implementation though – that is why it’s open source, so you and our peers may review it and keep it safe.

    <value>The appropriate use of encryption and other Technical Safeguards is governed by the HIPAA Security Standards, 45 CFR 160, 162 and 164. The relevant section is 164.312 Technical Safeguards.

It’s up to each and every organization to evaluate its position and risks, and then implement required or addressable specifications.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="SecurityBlock7Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Although the standard in no way refers to it except in comments, the CMS Internet Security Policy, which is the current view of Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services for their own use, does specify some minimal technology levels for certain cases.

    <value>We were looking for a way to store backups of sensitive financial data with one of our cloud providers and not risk exposure to their employees or outside forces. We decided that encrypting the backups before moving them to the cloud platform would solve that problem. However, the encryption process needed to be simple and easy to do or it would not be done. Furthermore, we wanted a safety net in case that person left the company and left us with encrypted files. AxCrypt provided an encryption solution that is super easy to use, and with the company account, we can implement a master key which will allow IT to decrypt any files in case of problems arising from users leaving encrypted files or forgetting passwords. Our financial person now happily goes about her job without having to wrestle with an onerous encryption process to provide the needed security. !</value>

  </data>
  <data name="UsageTipsMakingArchivesText1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>AxCrypt does not support storing many files in an archiver, like WinZip. This is for a reason – because WinZip (and Windows XP or later Compressed Folders) already does it so well!</value>

  <data name="UsageTipsMakingArchivesText2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>So, simply create your .zip-file, secure whatever you want to be there in it with AxCrypt, and then move it to the .zip-file.

    <value>When you store a document on a Local Area Network-server, the data is usually stored in clear-text there, even when access controls are in place, accessible to all system-administrators as well as others who by chance or mistake happen to get read-access.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="UsageTipsNetworksText3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The data also travels the network in the clear, easily sniffable by anyone on the same network segment. Backups are also seldom secured, so anyone gaining access to a backup-tape has potential access, regardless of the access controls enforced on the server.</value>

Use AxCrypt to secure the document, for example the PDF of the financial report. You can then distribute it by any means, hours and days ahead of time, the information is out there but unreadable. When it’s time to disclose, simply publish the password used. This reduces peak server loads and eases distribution.</value>

  <data name="UsageTipsSecuringFoldersText1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>AxCrypt secures files, individually. However, you can designate folders as ‘secured’. The folders will be monitored for new files, and AxCrypt will secure all new files with a single click, or when you sign out.</value>

    <value>Send secured files via email as regular attachments. To send secure email, add the recipient as allowed to open the file and, then send your secured files as regular attachments.
