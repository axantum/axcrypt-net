About the Solutions
===================

There are several different solutions (.sln) that are used, depending on the target and development environment.

AxCrypt.NET.sln            - The Windows Forms desktop client for Windows, Linux and Mac. Develop with Visual Studio or MonoDevelop on Windows, Linux or Mac.
AxCrypt-MonoForAndroid.sln - The Android app. Develop with Visual Studio or MonoDevelop on Windows, Linux or Mac.
AxCrypt-MonoMac.sln        - The MonoMac 'native' client for Mac. Develop with MonoDevelop on Mac.
AxCrypt-MonoTouch.sln      - The iOS app for iPhone and iPad. Develop with MonoDevelop on Mac.

Note that for 'AxCrypt-MonoTouch.sln' you must also build 'AxCrypt.NET.sln' in the approprate 'Debug' or 'Release' configuration, because
the 'Axantum.AxCrypt.Core.dll' dependency must be built by that solution.
