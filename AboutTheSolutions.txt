About the Solutions
===================

There is one solution (.sln) that is used.

Xecrets.Net.Core.sln    - The cross platform core libraries and command line client. Develop with Visual Studio or VS Code on Windows, Mac or Linux.

About the Projects
==================

Xecrets.Net is essentially a fork of the core libraries for AxCrypt as provided by AxCrypt AB, currently with as few changes as possible,
which does include compilation for .NET 8 and C# 11 with non-nullable reference types enabled. All new code is found in the namespaces
Xecrets.Net.* . To keep things separate and minimize changes to the original source, the orginal namespaces are preserved for existing
code, and typically maps as AxCrypt.* -> Xecrets.Net.*, with the exception being AxCrypt.Mono -> Xecrets.Net.Implementation .

At the time of this writing, the strategy is to minimize changes in original AxCrypt code to facilitate the possibility of merging
future changes by AxCrypt, although the main functional code has been untouched for several years. AxCrypt development has been
centered around the commercial aspects, and those parts are not used by Xecrets Net. In the future, we may make a decision to permanently
dissociate the code from the AxCrypt path, in which case a large part of the code here will be deleted. There is also much complexity
in the AxCrypt code to handle parallel processing and to keep a UI updated with notifications. We believe in a straighter simpler path,
and may also in the future clean out all such code as well thus reducing complexity and facilitating development and maintenance.

Xecrets.Net.Abstractions              - Core interfaces and some implementations. Has no dependencies to other projects.
Xecrets.Net.Common                    - Low-level implementations.
Xecrets.Net.Api                       - Mostly code for calling the AxCrypt server and other AxCrypt integrations, used sparingly by Xecrets.Net.
Xecrets.Net.BouncyCastle              - Custom implementation of BouncyCastle, used for public key cryptography. May be replaced in the future.
Xecrets.Cli                           - The Xecrets Command Line tool.
Xecrets.Net.Content                   - All strings originally translated by AxCrypt. Not really used, may be removed in the future.
Xecrets.Net.Core.csproj               - All core AxCrypt functionality.
Xecrets.Net.Implementation.csproj     - Implementations for .NET 8, common to all targets (Windows, Linux, Mac)
