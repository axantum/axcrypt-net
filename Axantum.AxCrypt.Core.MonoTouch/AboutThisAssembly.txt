About Axantum.AxCrypt.Core.MonoTouch

This assembly contains:
	- the linked Axantum.AxCrypt.Core source files, built for the MonoTouch runtime.
		- Exclusions: Version* since version checking is done by the iOS operating system.
		
	- the linked Axantum.AxCrypt.Mono source files, built for the MonoTouch runtime.
		- Exclusions: FileSystemWatcher, DataProtection (not applicable).
		
	- System.Diagnostics.TraceSwitch implementation.
	- System.Diagnostics.TraceLevel implementation.
	- System.Diagnostics.Trace implementation.

At this time, Mono and Windows are treated to be compatible and use the same implementation.

A platform specific implementation assembly should implement IRuntimeEnvironment, and the
interfaces exposed by methods and properties in that interface. This is currently:

IFileWatcher, ILauncher, IRuntimeFileInfo, ITiming and IWebCaller.

Code coverage is not required to be 100% here, but what reasonable can be tested should be.

FxCop should pass without complaint.
